This study is intended for describing the application of the Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal and the
time domain features acquired from its first and second derivatives for biometric identification. For this
purpose, a sum of 40 features has been extracted and a feature-ranking algorithm is proposed. This
proposed algorithm calculates the contribution of each feature to biometric recognition and collocates
the features, the contribution of which is from great to small. While identifying the contribution of the
features, the Euclidean distance and absolute distance formulas are used. The efficiency of the proposed
algorithms is demonstrated by the results of the k-NN (k-nearest neighbor) classifier applications of the
features. During application, each 15-period-PPG signal belonging to two different durations from each
of the thirty healthy subjects were used with a PPG data acquisition card. The first PPG signals recorded
from the subjects were evaluated as the 1st configuration; the PPG signals recorded later at a different
time as the 2nd configuration and the combination of both were evaluated as the 3rd configuration.
When the results were evaluated for the k-NN classifier model created along with the proposed
algorithm, an identification of 90.44% for the 1st configuration, 94.44% for the 2nd configuration, and
87.22% for the 3rd configuration has successfully been attained. The obtained results showed that both
the proposed algorithm and the biometric identification model based on this developed PPG signal are
very promising for contactless recognizing the people with the proposed method.

1. Introduction
The fact that today security comes into prominence more and
more each day brings the need for one to keep in his/her mind
much further and complicated codes and carry extra cards with
him/her and that this situation is getting far from practicality and
reliability boosts the need for biometric identification. Today most
of the systems like financial transactions, computer networks and
access into secure places still recognize the authorized people via
the identification card and password. Such systems are not secure
enough because of the fact that information can easily be stolen
and forgotten. Biometric systems are able to provide more relia-
bility and privacy since they work with the principle of identifying
the physical and behavioral characteristics of a person which are
possessed only by that person himself/herself and which distin-
guish him/her from others [1].
Certain distinctive features of our body or behavioral attributes,
such as finger print, face [2,3], voice [4], retina/iris [5], lip move-
ments [6], walking style [7], electroencephalography (EEG) [8] and
electrocardiography (ECG) [9,10] are viewed as means of human
identification. These applications based on biometric approaches
will provide us with a promising and irrefutable future of human
recognition. However, a finger print can be characterized with
latex, face recognition can be faked with a photograph, voice can
be imitated [11], and the EEG and ECG-based methods are
impractical as various electrodes are required in order to acquire
bio-signals.
PPG is a non-invasive electro-optical method which gives
information about the volume of blood flowing through a testing
zone of the body, close to the skin. In order to acquire PPG signal,
a source of light, the wavelength of which is λ, is placed on one
side of a jut of the body (e.g. a finger) and on the other side, a
photo-detector is placed right across the source to see the
transmitted light. A typical PPG signal consists of a large DC
component passing through the skin, muscle and bone without
passing through the blood vessels, a small AC component passing
directly through the blood vessels by detaching itself from the
skin, muscle and bone and also a light passing through the arterial
blood vessels. Shortly after the systole, the amount of blood in the
arteries increase, thus the intensity of light received decreases.
During the diastole, the amount of blood in the arteries decrease
and an increase in the light transmittance is observed. On a basic

measurement zone, 99% of the signal comes from the skin, muscle
and bone while 0.9% from the veins and 0.1% from the arteries [12].
In Fig. 1, the schematic diagram of the DCM03 reflective sensor
used for acquiring the PPG signal and a PPG signal-acquisition card
are seen [13].
The recommended method in this study comprises the new
feature extractions with PPG signals aiming at biometric recogni-
tion, data acquisition, pre-processing, PPG signaling and the
feature extraction of PPG signal using its first and second deriva-
tives, the recommendation of a feature ranking algorithm by
analyzing the contribution of the extracted features to biometric
recognition and the k-nearest neighbor classification processes. The
process of data acquisition was provided by 30 volunteers through
a PPG data acquisition card. Various artifacts like analog circuit
noises to be found in the signal acquired by pre-processing,
medium illuminance change, respiration and base deviation aris-
ing from movement are eliminated. 40 features of PPG signal in
the time domain, such as systolic peak, diastolic peak, augmenta-
tion index, peak-to-peak interval and pulse width were found
using the PPG signal and its derivates. For each of these features,
feature ranking process was performed by separately calculating
their contribution to biometric recognition. The first 5, 10, 15, 20,
25, 30, 35 and 40 of the ranked features were selected, and the
k-nearest neighbor classification method was used for each of them
separately.
2. Related works
In their studies, Gu et al. offer a new approach of human
verification using the PPG signals acquired easily from the finger-
tips. They performed their experimental studies on a group of 17
healthy subjects. They obtained four feature parameters from
digitized PPG signals. A feature vector template was formulated
using the recorded signals, and later on, the discriminant function
was applied in order to verify the data. This promising method of
human identification finally achieved a 90% success [1]. In another
study, two important inferences like the derivatives of PPG signals,
and the consistency of subjects within themselves and the
distinguishability among different subject are examined. Experi-
mental results suggest that using statistical instruments, the
derivatives can certainly indicate the features of one's PPG signal
and can be used as biometrics for recognition [14].
In another study, on the other hand, the feasibility of the
application of PPG signal as a single biometrical feature along with
the signal-processing methods for the matter involved are being
researched. The PPG signals were acquired from the fingertips of
29 healthy subjects. The experimental results suggest that when
PPG signals come under a controlled environment with infallible
sensors, biometrics for identification can also be used [15].
Wei et al., in their studies, addressed that PPG signals could
reflect numerous physiological parameters, such as heart func-
tions, blood vascular elasticity and blood viscosity. This is a new
non-invasive method with the advantages like smoothness and
accuracy. It is important to find out efficient pre-processing and
feature extraction algorithms in order to deal with the original
PPG signal that could be affected by many other factors. Most of
the practical methods include median and FIR (finite infinite
response) filtration. In this study, a new algorithm is recom-
mended in order to eliminate the wavelet transform-based base-
line deviation. The inference of feature spots is another important
issue. A sophisticated differential algorithm is used to solve this
problem. All these practical algorithms have created an effective
platform for determining the physiological parameters.[16]
Gu et al., in another study of theirs, have showed a fuzzy-logic
approach to examine the feasibility of the application of PPG
signals as a new method in the identification of humans.
The PPG signals were acquired from the fingertips of 17 healthy
subjects and were used as fuzzy entries for the classification of
four distinctive features. The rate of success in the fuzzy-based
decision can reach up to 94% in the same testing and 84% for two
different trials. This outcome suggests that this new PPG-based
biometry is potentially feasible in the verification of humans [17].
In another study, the design of an amplifier circuit intended for
extracting the DC component of the signal is being negotiated for
PPG signals. Consequently, a high AC signal with SNR (signal-to-
noise ratio) is acquired from a raw PPG signal, adding a bias-
adjusted circuit to the amplifier. This hardware development
resulted in acquiring a better signal quality and a data handling
convenience in recognition (identification) [18].
In another study, it was emphasized that the finger print of
someone could be imitated by placing a thin film or using the
artificial copy of that print in a biometric system operating via
finger scanning. This study researches into the possibility to utilize
the PPG signal as an additional parameter along with the finger
print. The uniqueness of a finger impact profile was approved in
the preliminary studies [19].
Venkatasubramanian et al., in their studies, stated that body
area networks (BAN) could play an important role in tracking the
health conditions of soldiers in the battle field. A secure BAN is
required to maintain the security of soldiers. This research offers a
key agreement protocol referred to as PPG-based PKA. This study
shows the feasibility of PPG signals to communicate over a
common symmetrical encoding key between two spots within
BAN [20].
Humphreys et al., in their studies, developed and tested an
image-based PPG system against the fingertip-based one often
used in the conventional clinical practices. Since a direct contact
with the tissue is required in conventional applications, perform-
ing such practices on a lesion makes them impossible to apply.
So as to cope with this inadequacy, a CMOS camera –based system
selecting the PPG signal without contacting the tissue was devel-
oped. The comparison of the conventional methods and the
conclusions yielded perfect results [21].
In another study, a contact-free reflection PPG (NRPPG) is being
developed for the purpose of monitoring the PPG signal features

and comparing it with a contact PPG (CPPG). The CPPG and NRPPG
signals acquired simultaneously from 22 healthy subjects are
studied. The power spectrums of these PPG signals are compared
among themselves and analyzed. The results suggest that NRPPG
can be used in the evaluation of cardio-physiological signals [22].
In yet another study, a CMOS camera-based imaging PPG
system (PPGI) is identified to perceive the blood vibrations in
the tissue. PPGI draws the attention to the potential applications in
the visualized blood flow. The change in the density of three
wavelengths (600 nm, 520 nm and 432 nm) is perceived within
each pixel of the image and analyzed. Special image processing
software was developed in order to obtain a two-dimensional map
of the blood flow measurements of the skin. High definition PPGI
images are derived from human fingers (by transmission mode)
and from face (by reflection mode) through evaluating them with
these three wavelengths. This newly-developed system could be
useful in tracking the skin blood flow for clinical applications [23].
In another study, it is cited that the optical sensors in which
photons are used as the detectors are becoming increasingly
significant in a non-invasive identification area. When compared
with EEG, MRI and FMRI, they are relatively cheap, easy-to-use and
easy -to-install. Among many optical sensors, PPG (photoplethys-
mography) sensors have the ability to measure the blood volume
changes of subcutaneous veins. The objective is the identifying
parameters like the heart rate and the respiratory rate. The heart
rate can be measured by the real-time PPG signals obtained from
the sensors. The detailed analyses of the frequency spectrum of
PPG signal suggest a cardiac peak at about 1 Hz for 60 heartbeats a
minute and a respiratory peak at about 0.25 Hz for 15 inhalation a
minute [24].
Ram et al., in their studies, have emphasized that the perfor-
mances of pulse oximetres are highly influenced by the motion
artifacts (MA) getting involved in the PPG signal. As a simple and
efficient approach, they propose an adaptive step-size least mean
squares (AS-LMS) adaptive filter for reducing MA s in corrupted
PPG signals [25].
In another study, on the other hand, while getting the PPG
signal, the most appropriate position for the sensor can be found
out by researching a low DC deviation in the signal. The AC
component is great in a position where the DC fluctuation is small
in the recommended PPG. Of the four blood vessels, dorsal,
palmer, ulnar and radial vessel areas, small DC amplitude and
large AC amplitude were observed in the ulnar vessel area [26].
3. Materials and methods
3.1. PPG biometrics dataset
In this study, PPG signals were acquired from a total of thirty
healthy volunteers, seventeen of whom are male and thirteen of
whom are female as shown in Table 1. The data were obtained
from their right index fingers while they were seated in a calm
position.
Prior to the acquisition of data, information regarding the study
was given to the volunteers, the questions they were curious about
were answered, the explanations as to the privacy of the data and
their personal information and keeping them within the limits of
scientific studies were made, and they were given a form to fill out
the information about their consent and approval of volunteering
to participate in this study. A 15-period-signal (each) was acquired
from each individual at two different time spans. 40 characteristic
features were extracted for each period. The Z-score method was
used in standardizing these characteristic feature variables. The
1st configuration data set with the characteristic features acquired
by the first received signals from the subjects, the 2nd configura-
tion data set with the characteristic features received at a different
time later on and a 3rd configuration data set by combining these
two data sets were built up. In order to enable the permanency of
the characteristic features acquired from the volunteers to be
evaluated with more than one example within a given time in due
course, datasets of the 1st configuration and the 2nd configuration
were created. A dataset of the 3rd configuration was created to be
able to identify the characteristic features which had duration in
time. In Fig. 2, the acquisition of PPG signal from a volunteer is
demonstrated.
3.2. The proposed PPG biometrics recognition system
In this study, the system, the block diagram of which is shown
in Fig. 3 is recommended. In this system were the PPG signals
acquired by a PPG data acquisiton card with a STM32F103xC ARM

based 32 bit microcontroller and a 2 kHz sampling frequency, and
on which there is a DCM03 reflective sensor. In order to debug the
noises in the PPG signal as a pre-processing, a FIR low-pass filter
with N¼ 200 points 10 Hz cut-off frequency was utilized. The first
and the second derivatives are calculated via the filtered PPG signal.
40 time domain features are acquired by normalizing the
filtered PPG and its derivatives to the range of 0–1. These
characteristic features are used for the purpose of classification
after
the
feature
ranking
and
feature
selection
processes,
respectively.
3.2.1. Differentiation stage
The formula for differentiation has to provide three character-
istics for one-dimensional digital signals:
1. Both the first and the second derivatives should be zero where
the function is constant.
2. The first derivative should be constant and the second deriva-
tive should be zero for the decreasing and increasing beams.
3. At the beginning of the decreasing and increasing curves, the
first derivative should be different from zero, and the second
derivative, on the other hand, should be different from zero
both at the beginning and the end of them.
These are the three characteristics of the common math
differentiation.
Considering
these
characteristics,
the
derivative
for
one-
dimensional signals can be calculated as follows:
1st derivative :
∂f
∂x ¼ f ðxþ1Þ�f ðxÞ
ð1Þ
2nd derivative :
∂2f
∂x2 ¼ f ðxþ1Þþf ðx�1Þ�2f ðxÞ
ð2Þ
In Fig. 4, the first and the second derivative applications for a
one-dimensional signal are shown.
3.2.2. Feature extraction stage: time domain features
At this stage, characteristic features are extracted from PPG
signal and its first and second derivatives. In Figs. 5 and 6, the
relation between PPG signal and its first and second derivative is
shown, respectively. Feature points in PPG signals are determined
using these correlations.
In Figs. 7 and 8 are all the feature spots shown. The first
detected feature spots are the systolic peak points. Then for the
first derivative previous to the position of these systolic peak
points in PPG signal, there is the first peak point which is a1; for
the second derivative, there is the first peak and there are a2 and
b2 points which are the first pit points. Then comes b1, e1, f1
points for the first derivative and e2 and f2 for the second
derivative following the position of systolic peak point. By these
feature spots detected in the time domain, 40 characteristic
features were calculated, such as x (systolic peak), y (diastolic
peak), z (dicrotic notch), tpi (pulse interval), tpp (peak to peak), y/x
(augmentation index), (x�y)/x (alternative augmentation index),
z/x|(y�z)|/x, t1 (systolic peak time), t2 (dicrotic notch time), t3

3.2.3. Feature ranked stage: distance based supervised feature
ranked algorithm
A feature ranking algorithm is proposed for the 40 features
calculated during this study. The proposed ranking algorithm is
used as a matrix input which consists of n period, which has, for
each period, an m�1 different feature and classification label and
which has n line m column. Our objective is to determine the
features that will classify each period accurately using the distance
functions and to rank the features according to the percentage of
accurate classification. To that end, this feature ranking algorithm
is proposed.

a matrix of distances is formed in this way:
In order for the success of the classification of any feature to be
high, it is expected that the distance of column elements of the

this reason, this matrix was formed.

scores are calculated for all the elements of matrix D, the
following matrix S is achieved.
In matrix S obtained, a sequence of m�1 elements is achieved
by the gathering of each column elements among themselves

The sj in this sequence shows the score of j. feature.
While the scores of number of m�1 feature from j¼1 are being
lined up from great to small, the labels of features, that is to say,
m. column lines up in the same row and an array of features
ranked (AOFR) is achieved.

to redundant and irrelevant features. At the stage of feature
ranking, such redundant and irrelevant features rank last in AOFR.
In this stage of study, the first 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40
features from the ranked ones are selected and several classifica-
tion accomplishments are made for k¼1, 3, 5, 7, 10 values by
means of k-nearest neighbor classification method. The number of
features yielding the best classification achievement and k value
are selected as the classifier model.
In this case, a decision as to how many of the ranked features
must be selected first should be made. In particular, the reason for
the first ranked ones to be 5, 10, …, 40 during the selection is to
allow for a less amount of time for the processing time. Here, if
required, the selection can be made in the form of 1, 2, 3, …, 40,
however, the processing time will multiply fivefold. Of these
ranked features selected, the step value in the form of the first
5 features can be put to the user request. This process has been
suggested as a method of research for the best classification
performance.
3.2.5. Classification stage: distance based classifier algorithms
This is the process of determining what individuals the input
signals of the utilized methods belong to in cases where the
characteristic feature points obtained from the classification input
signals are qualitative. The purpose, here, is to identify the class
label of the input signal in a space of a given number classes. The
concept of similarity is usually defined by the reversal of distance.
In the distance-based classification, minimum distance is used for
high similarity. The most popular method performing classifica-
tion by utilizing the distances between the characteristic feature
points is the k-nearest neighbors algorithm.
k-Nearest neighbors algorithm
� k value is arbitrarily determined.
� The distances between the characteristic feature points with
unknown class labels and those with the known class labels are
calculated. In general, the Euclidean distance is utilized.
� The calculated distances are ranked. The closest k number of
class labels with the smallest distance are ascertained.
� Among the k number of class labels ascertained, the one with
the majority is determined. This determined class label is
assigned as the outcome of the unknown class.
In order for the classification success to be assessed objectively,
methods referred to as cross validation should be applied. In these
methods, the data contained within the system are divided in two

as the training dataset and the testing dataset. The training data
are used to train the system, whereas the testing data are utilized
to evaluate the success of the trained system. In the literature,
three types of cross validation methods are proposed:
� Repeated random sub-sampling validation;
� K-fold cross-validation;
� Leave-one-out cross-validation.
In the repeated random sub-sampling validation, the training
and testing data are randomly selected from the dataset. This is
the method ensuring the highest level of success within the cross
validation.
In the K-fold cross-validation, the dataset is divided into k
pieces of folds. One fold is used for the testing data, and the
remaining K�1 folds are combined and employed as training data.
This process is repeated K times through the transposition of the

sets. For the success status, the average of K number of success
values is taken.
Leave-one-out cross-validation method is quite similar to
the K-fold cross-validation. The leave-one-out cross-validation
method for the dataset consisting of N number of samples is the
application of the K-fold method as in: K¼N.
During
this
stage,
the
k-nearest
neighbor
classification
algorithm was used. Through leave-one-out method, the classifi-
cation success was achieved. The k-nearest neighbor algorithm
categorizes by means of using the distances between data points.
In order to identify the class of any PPG period, separate distances
are
calculated
between
the
feature
spots
extracted
from
that period and those extracted from all the PPG periods, the
classes of which are known. As for distance, the Euclidean distance
was used in this study. The selected number of k labels with the
majority of the class label of the most closely known period was
determined as the class of an unknown period.
4. Results and discussion
In this study, a classification model was built up for biometric
identification, with the PPG signals acquired from 30 volunteers.
40 features were extracted using PPG signals and its derivatives.

A feature ranking algorithm was proposed in order to rank these
features. In the proposed feature ranking algorithm, k¼ 3, 5, 7 and
10 values were applied for majority voting. The selection process,
in particular, was done by picking out the first ranked 5, 10, 15, 20,
25, 30, 35 and 40 features separately and by deciding as to how
many features had to be selected considering the one with the
highest achievement of classification. The classification process
was done by utilizing the k-nearest neighbor classifier algorithm
and leave-one-out transposition for k¼1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 values.
In Table 2, the ranked features are shown according to k values
used in the feature ranking algorithm for the 1st configuration.
The percentages of classification success are shown in Table 3. The
percentages of classification success are calculated using the
ranked features for k¼5 value in Table 2. The best classification
success was achieved as 90.44% for k¼1 value of the classification
algorithm where the first 25 features were used. Besides, it is seen
that when there is no feature selection and ranking process in
Table 3, a 89.33% of classification success at most could be
achieved for the classification algorithm k¼1 value in the event
that all the features are used. In this case, a 1.11% of increase in the
classification success was attained through the feature ranking and
selection process for the 1st configuration. The percentages of
classification success for the 1st configuration are graphically
shown in Fig. 9. The performance measurement values calculated
from
this
matrix,
such
as
precision,
recall,
specificity
and
f-measure, are shown in Table 4.
Similarly, in Table 5, the ranked features according to the
k values used in the feature ranking algorithm are shown for the
2nd configuration. In Table 6 are the percentages of classification
success shown. They are calculated using the ranked features for
k¼5 value in Table 5. The best classification success was achieved
as 94.44% for k¼1 value of the classification algorithm where the
first 20 features were used. Besides, it is seen that when there is no
feature selection and ranking process in Table 6, a 90.22% of
classification success at most could be achieved for the classifica-
tion algorithm k¼1 value in the event that all the features are
used. In this case, a 4.22% of increase in the classification success
was attained through the feature ranking and selection process for
the 2nd configuration. The percentages of classification success for
the 2nd configuration are graphically shown in Fig. 10. The
performance measurement values calculated from this matrix,
such as precision, recall, specificity and f-measure are shown in
Table 7.
Similarly, in Table 8, the ranked features according to the k
values used in the feature ranking algorithm are shown for the
3rd configuration. In Table 9 are the percentages of classification
success shown. They are calculated using the ranked features
for k¼5 value in Table 8. The best classification success was
achieved as 87.22% for k¼3 value of the classification algorithm
where the first 15 features were used. Besides, it is seen that
when there is no feature selection and ranking process in Table 9,
a 84.22% of classification success at most could be achieved for
the classification algorithm k¼1 value in the event that all the
features are used. In this case, a 3% of increase in the classification
success was attained through the feature ranking and selection
process for the 3rd configuration. The percentages of classifica-
tion success for the 3rd configuration are graphically shown in
Fig. 11. The performance measurement values calculated from
this matrix, such as precision, recall, specificity and f-measure are
shown in Table 10.
When Tables 2 and 6 are compared, the ranking of 40 features
acquired for the 1st configuration and the 2nd configuration is not
the same, which suggests that the features could rank differently
in achieving the best performance depending on time. Since the
3rd configuration is formed by the combination of the 1st config-
uration and the 2nd configuration, the features ranked in Table 10
are more accurate than those in Tables 2 and 6 in the evaluation of
the features with duration in time.
The diagrams in Figs. 12 and 13 are given in order to demon-
strate, for biometric recognition, the availability of the major
features extracted as time-domain from the PPG signal. In
Fig. 12, according to the first three major features selected through
DBSFRA for the 1st configuration, the 2nd configuration and the
3rd configuration, the distributions of classification of 6 individuals
are shown. In Fig. 13, on the other hand, The PPG signal periods of
an individual and the alteration of the major features selected
through DBSFRA among these periods are separately depicted for
the
1st
configuration,

2nd
configuration
and

5. Conclusions and future works
In this study, 40 characteristic features were acquired using the
PPG signal and its first and second derivatives. A system intended
for the application of these features was performed for biometric
identity authentication. The duration of the 40 features received
from the volunteers within this proposed system was evaluated
through two samples different from each other in time.

t1 (systolic peak
time)
Alty et al. [29] proved that the crest time is a useful feature for cardiovascular disease classification. They developed a method to
classify subjects into high and low pulse wave velocity (equivalent to high and low cardio vascular disease risk) using features
extracted from the PPG
26
b2/a2
Takazawa et al. [30] demonstrated that the b/a ratio reflects increased arterial stiffness, hence the b/a ratio increases with age.
Imanaga et al. [31] provided a direct evidence that magnitude of b/a of the APG is related to the distensibility of the peripheral artery,
and suggest that the magnitude of b/a is a useful non-invasive index of atherosclerosis and altered arterial distensibility
Aiba et al. [32] suggested the parameter -b/a in the exposure group dose dependently decreased with increases in length of working
career (duration of exposure to lead) and blood lead concentration (Pb–B). The parameter �b/a significantly decreased in subjects
with working careers of 5 years or more and in subjects whose Pb–B was 40 g/100 ml or more. While Nousou et al. [33] found that the
b/a index discriminates independently between subjects with essential hypertension and healthy controls
Otsuka et al. [34] found that the b/a, is positively correlated to the Framingham risk score. Framingham risk score has been used to
estimate individual risk of cardiovascular heart disease. Their results suggest that b/a index might contribute to the discrimination of
the high-risk subjects for cardiovascular heart disease
Baek et al. [35] confirmed that the b/a ratio increases with age
5
Peak to peak tpp
The R–R interval in the ECG signal correlates closely with the peak–peak interval APG signal as both represent a completed heart
cycle. The peak–peak interval has been used to detect the heart in PPG signals [36,37]
13
IPA¼A2/A1
Wang et al. [38] have divided the pulse area into two areas at the dicrotic notch. They found that the ratio of the two areas, can be
used as an indicator of total peripheral resistance. This ratio is called the inflection point area ratio (IPA)
27
e2/a2
Takazawa et al. [30] demonstrated that an increase of the e/a ratio reflects decreased arterial stiffness, and that the e/a ratio decreases
with age. Baek et al. [35] confirmed that the e/a ratios decreases with age

At this stage, our experimental studies have been confined to
these mentioned so far as this has been the first study of ours we
have been working on. The feature points to be acquired in
consequence of the evaluations to be performed through further
examples different from each other in time would be a more
accurate approach in achieving the best result for identity authen-
tication. It was observed that the feature ranking and selection
algorithm we proposed boosted the classification success of the
system. Moreover, the rates of success provided here are found by
means of separately assessing each period acquired from the
volunteers. In fact, it is seen that while performing identity
authentication, success will be boosted further when authentica-
tion is performed by taking into consideration the majority voting
of more than one period to be received from an individual. The
results obtained suggest that the use of the PPG signal for
biometric authentication is very promising. In our prospective
studies, we will be increasing the success for the matter involved
by also carrying out frequency-based analyses as well as the
features acquired from PPG signals at time domain.
