Abstract— 
Advancements 
in 
wireless 
sensor 
network 
technologies have enabled the proliferation of miniaturized body-
worn sensors, capable of long-term pervasive biomedical signal 
monitoring. Remote cardiovascular monitoring has been one of 
the beneficiaries of this development, resulting in non-invasive, 
photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors being used in ambulatory 
settings. Wrist-worn PPG, although a popular alternative to 
electrocardiogram (ECG), suffers from motion artifacts inherent 
in daily life. Hence, in this paper, we present a novel deep learning 
framework (CorNET) to efficiently estimate heart rate (HR) 
information and perform biometric identification (BId) using only 
wrist-worn, single-channel PPG signal collected in ambulant 
environment. We have formulated a completely personalized data-
driven approach, using a four-layer deep neural network. Two 
convolution neural network layers are used in conjunction with 
two long short-term memory layers, followed by a dense output 
layer for modelling the temporal sequence inherent within the 
pulsatile signal representative of cardiac activity. The final dense 
layer is customized with respect to the application, functioning as: 
a) regression layer - having a single neuron to predict HR; b) 
classification layer - two neurons which identifies a subject among 
a group. The proposed network was evaluated on the TROIKA 
dataset having 22 PPG records collected during various physical 
activities. We achieve a mean absolute error of 1.47±3.37 BPM for 
HR estimation and an average accuracy of 96% for BId on 20 
subjects. CorNET was further evaluated successfully in an 
ambulant use-case scenario with custom sensors for two subjects.

I. INTRODUCTION 
ARDIOVASCULAR monitoring using wearable sensors has 
primarily focused on processing electrocardiography 
(ECG) for key applications – heart rate (HR) monitoring, 
disease detection/prognosis, sports, biometric identification 
(BId), etc. [1-5]. ECG is limited in terms of its placement 
(requires ground and reference sensors proximal to chest) for 
signal fidelity, making it inefficient in terms of wearability in

ambulant daily living conditions. PPG sensors provide the 
distinct advantage of having a small form factor and incur low-
cost, making them a popular alternative for embedding onto 
wearable devices (e.g. smart watch) [6-8]. PPG signals are 
obtained from pulse oximeters, emitting light (using light 
emitting diode) on the skin and measuring (using photodiode) 
the miniature variations in reflected or transmitted light 
intensity. The periodicity of light corresponds to the cardiac 
rhythm, often used for HR estimation. PPG sensors provide a 
convenient solution as they can be acquired from peripheral 
positions such as earlobes, fingertips or wrist, with the latter 
considered favorable for unobtrusive daily usage. However, 
data collected from a wrist-worn device is vulnerable to motion 
artifacts (MA), which correspondingly distorts the signal 
fidelity, inhibiting the robust estimation of vital parameters [9].  
MA are caused by several factors – physical activity, ambient 
light leaking through the widening gap between sensor and the 
skin surface during motion and change in blood flow due to 
movements. This causes the spectral component of the MA to 
overpower the heart-beat related PPG component [10]. A host 
of signal processing techniques have been proposed to 
remove/attenuate MA using adaptive filtering [11], Kalman 
filtering [12], wiener filtering [13], independent component 
analysis [14], empirical mode decomposition (EMD) [15], 
spectral subtraction [10] and feature-engineering based learning 
algorithms [16-17]. Such methods have often used a motion 
reference signal from an external sensor (e.g. accelerometer), 
for detecting and removing MA resulting from motion. The 
majority of this research was propelled by the IEEE Signal 
Processing Cup (SPC) 2015. It focused on HR estimation from 
wrist-worn, two green light illuminated PPG channels, 
collected during vigorous physical activities [10]. Although 
successful, the reported improvements in performance are 
usually accompanied by heuristic thresholds or a large number 
of expertly-tuned free parameters which could prevent 
generalization of the developed methodologies. 
In this paper, we propose a learning-based framework,

CorNET, for reliable HR estimation, using only a single channel 
wrist-worn PPG signal, collected in ambulant conditions. The 
proposed framework is based on the fundamentals of Deep 
Neural Network (DNN). DNN obviates the requirement for 
feature engineering (extraction/selection of hand-crafted 
features necessitating domain knowledge), and has been 
successful in a wide range of applications. Our exploration has 
been further motivated by the success of a DNN based approach 
[18], reported recently for BId using one-dimensional PPG 
signals, collected in ambulant environment. A data-driven 
methodology, BiometricNET [18], has been successfully used 
to model the underlying temporal sequence within the pulsatile 
cardiac signal based on a convolution neural network (CNN) 
with long and short term memory (LSTM).  
The contributions in this paper are built upon [18], reporting 
a generic framework, CorNET, comprising of two-layer CNN, 
two-layer LSTM and a final dense layer (DL). The work in [18] 
has been extended on two aspects: 
• 
new target application, i.e. HR monitoring and 
• 
validation on 22 SPC PPG records and 2 custom records. 
This necessitated customizing the DL for two key applications, 
functioning as – a) regression layer, having a single neuron to 
estimate HR and b) classification layer, having two neurons for 
BId. The framework operating on a single green channel PPG 
signal, was evaluated on the SPC database. It achieves a mean 
absolute error of 1.47±3.37 beats per minute (BPM) for HR 
estimation on 22 PPG records collected during various physical 
activities and 96% accuracy for BId on 20 subjects (larger 
cohort compared to [18]). We further successfully evaluate 
CorNET in an ambulant daily living scenario, using bespoke 
sensor platforms, on two subjects having different skin types, 
over a longer monitoring duration. The paper is structured as 
follows. Section II describes the motivation and problem 
formulation using a learning-based approach. The proposed 
methodology highlighting the DNN fundamentals and the 
developed network architecture, CorNET, have been detailed in 
section III. The results, comparison with state-of-the-art 
approaches and complexity analysis for CorNET have been 
presented in section IV. The paper has been concluded and 
future research avenues have been discussed in section V.  
II. MOTIVATION AND PROBLEM FORMULATION 
State-of-the-art research using wrist-PPG has primarily 
focused on using green light [10], having a shorter wavelength 
(in comparison to red/infra-red), as the illuminating source. It 
provides a distinct advantage of producing large intensity 
variations to cardiac modulation and yields a better signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR) [19]. Moreover, reflective system, with LED 
and photodetector (PD) on the same side is the preferred mode 
(in comparison to transmitive) due to user comfort [20]. An 
illustration of the effect of MA on HR estimation has been 
shown in Fig. 1, with an example PPG segment collected during 
walking and transition from walking to running. The spectral 
information, reflected in the peak due to MA is higher 
compared to the HR peak (encircled in bottom plot). It is evident 
from Fig. 1, that the widely used periodogram, computed 
through FFT, has high variance in spectrum estimation and 
suffers from leakage effects. A TROIKA framework [10], 
based on signal decomposition, sparsity-based spectral 
estimation and peak tracking, was successful in estimating HR 
every 2 seconds (s) from 8s of MA-affected PPG windows, 
reporting 2.34 BPM error on 12 subjects (SPC). It was followed 
by an improvement, formulating a multiple measurement vector 
model, computing the spectra of PPG and acceleration jointly, 
reporting 1.28 BPM on the same dataset [21]. Recently, an 
approach based on Wiener filtering and phase vocoder (WFPV) 
has produced comparative results with 1.02 and 1.97 BPM on 
12 and 23 SPC PPG recordings respectively [13].

transition from walking to running (right) respectively. The highest PPG 
spectral peak does not coincide with true HR (encircled) during intense motion. 
 
Further developments based on short-time Fourier transform 
[22], adaptive normalized least mean square (NLMS) filters 
[23], singular value decomposition [24] and wavelet 
decomposition [25], using both PPG channels and/or 
accelerometer data (as motion reference) have been 
successfully used. A learning algorithm (Random Forest) in 
conjunction with features, were used to detect beat vs inter-beat 
samples, allowing HR estimation with 2.86% classification 
error [16]. Another recent approach has used probabilistic 
methods, feature extraction and a 3-layer multi-layer perceptron 
with 22 neurons, reporting 2.81 BPM on 23 PPG recordings of 
SPC [17]. The algorithms based on spectral processing, involve 
heuristic thresholds and custom post-processing steps, whereas 
the learning algorithms have relied on feature engineering.  
We propose to use an ECG-assisted supervised framework 
for HR estimation from PPG data. During a dedicated training 
phase, the relationship between each PPG window (frame) and 
the HR computed from corresponding ECG frame (considered 
as ground truth) are learnt. Once trained, the model predicts HR 
for a test PPG dataset. The predictions are verified against 
ground truth HR and the error magnitude is averaged over the 
number of observations and reported in BPM. We formulate a 
subject-specific (personalized) use-case scenario as opposed to 
a subject-independent (generalized) validation for our proposed 
framework. The basic premise of this use-case rests on the fact 
that biological signals are influenced by various physiological 
factors – age, sex, height, weight/body-mass-index, etc. and

most importantly the cardiac condition of a given subject.  The 
unified CorNet framework (network layers, filter sizes) is 
trained for each subject, ensuring proportional representation of 
training examples, which is envisaged for a real-life use-case 
scenario as illustrated in Fig. 2. We aim to collect baseline data 
(PPG, ECG) for a given subject, incorporating all possible 
variations for better generalization, use it to train a cross-
validated model and employ it for inference during daily living.

For this exploration, we evaluate our algorithm on two 
databases: a) IEEE SPC 2015 and b) IMEC database (IMEC-
Db). We use the SPC database in view of its popularity for state-
of-the-art research. It comprises PPG signals of 5-minute 
duration, from 20 healthy subjects, age ranging 18 to 58 [10]. 
Each subject’s data contains simultaneous recordings of - two 
channels of PPG from the wrist (dorsal) using a pulse oximeter 
with green LED (wavelength: 515 nm); tri-axial accelerometer 
signals from the wrist, and a channel of ECG from the chest 
using wet ECG electrodes. The ECG signal acts as the ground-
truth for PPG-based HR estimation. All signals were sampled 
at 125 Hz and transmitted to a computer through Bluetooth. 
PPG window (frame) lengths considered for this exploration 
was 8s (sliding by 2s), like ECG-HR computation. The subjects 
performed three types of activities. First, Type1 (T1), 
performed by subjects 1-12, involving walking or running on a 
treadmill with the following speeds in order: 1–2 km/h for 0.5 
min, 6–8 km/h for 1 min, 12–15 km/h for 1 min, 6–8 km/h for 
1 min, 12–15 km/h for 1 min, and 1–2 km/h for 0.5 min. The 
subjects used their hand (with wristband) to pull clothes, wipe 
sweat on forehead, and push buttons on the treadmill. Second, 
Type2 (T2), performed by subjects 14, 15, 18 and 20, involved 
in forearm/upper arm exercises (e.g. shake hands, stretch, push, 
running, jump, and push-ups). Last, Type3 (T3), performed by 
subjects 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19, involving intense arm 
movements (e.g. boxing). Hence, we have 20 subjects and 22 
records in total, since subjects 15 and 18 were involved in both 
T2 and T3. 
The IMEC-Db serves as an experimental evaluation 
platform, collected in complete ambulatory settings with 
bespoke sensor platforms. Experiments were performed at 
IMEC, Belgium, with a customized wristband (since to the best 
of knowledge, most commercial versions do not provide access 
to raw PPG data, quintessential for research) and a custom 3-
channel ECG patch (IMEC AFE) [26]. The PPG-based wrist 
module uses an Osram SFH 7060 LED [27] (‘green’ and ‘infra-
red’) and PD module with TIAFE 4403 [28] as the front end. 
Both sensing platforms, shown in Fig. 3, are IMEC research 
prototypes and suited our requirement for a proof-of-concept 
evaluation of CorNET. The ECG and PPG signals were 
sampled at 256 Hz and saved on a SD card and an eMMC 
respectively, on these devices. The IMEC-Db comprises data 
collected from two subjects (different ethnic backgrounds), 
male/female, age ranging 25-35, with their informed consent, 
in natural office environment, where they were encouraged to 
carry on with their daily activities. Both subjects started with an 
initial rest period of five minutes which helps to synchronize 
the PPG and ECG data streams. The synchronization was based 
on the accelerometers (sensitivity: ±2g, sampling at 32 Hz), 
present in both sensor modules. Activities performed generally 
varied from sitting and working with a computer (keyboard 
typing, mouse handling, etc.), having coffee, washroom use, 
taking stairs up/down three floors (several times), talking and 
performing hand gestures. All activities were performed in a 
completely voluntary manner, ensuring variability within the 
data. A naturalistic-ambulant experiment protocol was selected, 
since it best captures situations where PPG signal quality is 
affected by micro/fine-grain motion performed within a 
working environment. Such movements (e.g. finger tapping, 
pronation/supination, with wrist in relatively stable position) 
are difficult to be detected by an accelerometer integrated in a 
wristband. The wristband module performs continuous 
automatic calibration, ensuring optimal PPG signal for a given 
skin tone. Data was collected from Subject 1 and 2 for 
approximately two and seven hours respectively. The 
differences in duration for the two subjects were aimed at 
observing the effect of training duration on HR estimation.

Besides extracting clinical information, biological signals 
have long been used for automated recognition of individuals, 
commonly termed as Biometrics by the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO) [29]. Common 
characteristics include fingerprints, iris, DNA, etc. However, 
signals such as PPG [30], ECG [31] and electroencephalograms 
(EEG) [32], provide distinct biological characteristics and an 
insight into the clinical condition, which paves the way for 
personalization and identification of individuals. Furthermore, 
such signals can be captured for long durations without manual 
intervention, enabling continuous authentication systems. 
Given the form factor and ease of unobtrusive use in daily life, 
PPG based BId has emerged as an alternative to ECG, however 
majority of PPG-based work have used signals collected in 
controlled clinical settings which are less prone to MA, hence, 
rendering these models unsuitable for ambulatory usage.

frequency domain (Fourier) analysis, correlation analysis, 
learning based methodology employing hand crafted features 
with a k-nn classifier [33], fuzzy-logic [30][34], and Linear 
Discriminant Analysis [35], yielding high accuracies between 
90-95%. A recent work focused on wrist-worn, ‘green’ PPG 
under motion, using a two-stage procedure, involving clustering 
and learning techniques (Restricted Boltzmann Machines and 
Deep Belief Networks) [36]. Although promising, the method 
had various shortcomings such as potential non-unique 
clustering of subjects, use of hand-crafted features, significant 
overhead in cluster formation, which have been discussed in 
[18] and correspondingly a fully data-driven, personalized, 
deep learning approach has been proposed in [18].  
A binary classification (one vs rest) approach is adopted in 
[18], to identify a subject against a group based on their PPG 
signal. The errors of the target class are weighed according to 
the unbalanced class distribution (e.g. the imbalance of 19:1 for 
a cohort of 20 subjects in SPC) during training, illustrated in 
Fig. 4, allowing the network to learn the underlying data 
distribution in contrary to predicting the dominant zero-class 
(i.e. ‘rest’-class). The network learns subject specific features 
from respective PPG and hence requires training for each new 
user. Although a disadvantage, since it necessitates subject-
specific data collection over an initial period, network training 
and weight downloading back to a commercial device, a multi-
class classification paradigm would not be feasible to 
implement. This is because subject-specific training examples 
would not be available during initial training and having a class 
for each subject, would cause an unbounded number of classes. 
Motivated by this problem formulation, we adapt the network 
topology [18] to extend it for both HR estimation and BId (using 
only PPG) as outlined in Section III. 
 
 
Fig. 4. Binary (one vs rest) classification adopted for BId on SPC. 
III. PROPOSED FRAMEWORK 
An overview of our framework for HR estimation and BId is 
shown in Fig. 5, illustrating the ECG-HR assisted training and 
validation for the former application. The PPG data samples are 
pre-processed with a band-pass 4th order Butterworth filter 
having cut-off frequencies 0.1 – 18 Hz. It restricts the high 
frequency noise component and DC drifts from the signal of 
interest. The filtered signal is further normalized to zero mean 
and unit variance. 
A. CNN and LSTM 
The taxonomy of DNN primarily includes multi-layer 
perceptron’s (MLP), CNN, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). 
They enable learning of task-adapted feature representations 
from the data [37]. CNNs are characterized by an initial layer 
of convolutional filters (set of weights which slides over the 
input), followed by non-linearity (activation function – rectified 
linear units), sub-sampling (pooling), and fully connected layer 
which realizes the classification [38]. The stacking of multiple 
convolutional layers helps achieving automatic feature 
extraction, where downstream layers capture more complex or 
differentiating features. This aids to integrate information from 
different filters and various levels of abstraction.  
RNNs are an effective choice for analyzing time series data 
for inferring sequential/time-variant information, since they 
incorporate contextual information from past inputs and are 
robust to localized distortions in the input sequence along time. 
A bottleneck for deep CNN structures (with increased network 
capability) is the vanishing gradient (long chain problem) 
wherein information from previous computations is rapidly 
attenuated with progression through the data flow [39]. RNNs 
applied to long sequential data suffer similarly, as all time steps 
have the same weight and consequently, the contribution of an 
input in the hidden state is subjected to exponential decay. 
LSTM, a variant of RNN, uses a memory block [39] inspired 
by a computer memory cell, where context-dependent input, 
output, and forget gates control what is written, read and kept 
in the cell in each time-step. Hence, it becomes convenient for 
the network to store a given input over many time steps, in 
effect helping LSTM layers to capture temporal properties. 
B. CorNET architecture 
The data driven approach is realized by allowing the network 
to learn discriminatory features, accomplished by using a two 
layer 1-D CNN, which can be thought of as a feature extractor. 
The input is convolved with the filters to generate points in the 
temporal-feature domain. Corresponding layers use these 
features to convolve with additional filters to generate the final 
features from the time-series PPG input. One potential 
drawback of CNN is that the generated features are not 
completely phase invariant. Depending on the time of 
occurrence of the heart beat relative to the beginning of the 
sample, the relevant features will be slightly shifted. Hence, 
LSTM being instrumental in capturing the temporal 
dependency amidst the sequence of historical local trends of the 
underlying cardiac activity in PPG signals, further helps to 
recover from the phase offset. The output from CNN is fed into 
two LSTM layers and finally, its output is passed through a DL 
which is customized for the application. DL consist of a set of 
weights for each neuron that is multiplied by the input and 
summed to give the neuron’s activation. Since, it is critical to 
apply the correct activation function to DL, a single neuron with 
linear transfer function (activation) is used on the LSTM output 
to estimate a  continuous HR value. For BId, two neurons are 
used with SoftMax transfer function to generate a probability 
estimation between the target and rest classes.

C. Implementation 
CorNET for HR estimation and BId was trained on an Nvidia 
Tesla K80 GPU and is modeled in Keras version 2.0.4 [40], 
configured to use theano [41] version 0.0.9 as the backend.  
Each CNN layer consists of a 1-D CNN operation with 
Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation [42], whereas each 
LSTM layer used hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function. There is a 
batch normalization layer following the RELU activation. The 
max-pooling layers used a pool size of 4 and dropout layer with 
rate 0.1.  Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) is used as 
the optimizer with the default hyperparameters which is 
recommended for training recurrent networks [43]. For BId, as 
described earlier (section II), the class loss is weighted to offset 
the class imbalance. Training batch size is set to 25 to balance 
the training time and sensitivity to individual inputs.

The proposed CorNET topology, illustrated in Fig. 6, uses a 
filter size of 40 (sF) in both CNN layers, with number of filters 
as 32 (nF). A size of 128 units (nU) was used for both LSTM 
layers 
working 
in 
conjunction 
with 
CNN. 
These 
hyperparameters were optimized using a heuristic grid search 
method and selected parameters yielded the best performance. 
Increasing sF, nF, nU or number of layers (nL) beyond the ones 
selected here did not result in an improved overall performance. 
IV. RESULTS 
The SPC database comprises temporally interleaved data 
representing sequence of activities (e.g. T1) and hence we 
perform, leave-one-window-out validation. Here, each window 
is tested upon and the rest of the windows are considered for 
training, with a gap of three windows maintained between train-
test data, accounting for the 6s overlap. This selection strategy 
ensures that there is no data overlap between train and test sets 
and furthermore, the use of max-pooling and dropout layer in 
conjunction with CNN, helps to avoid overfitting. The 
performance of CorNET has been evaluated with respect to 
standard metrics [10], which have been briefly described here. 
We compute absolute error (AE), as the absolute difference 
between true HRE (from ECG) and estimated HRP (from PPG), 
as shown in (1), i being the respective window. 
 
𝐴𝐸𝑖 = 𝑎𝑏𝑠(𝐻𝑅𝐸𝑖 − 𝐻𝑅𝑃𝑖)             (1) 
 
Correspondingly, the mean absolute error (MAE) and the 
standard deviation of the absolute error (SDAE) over all 
processed windows, are computed and compared with state-of-
the-art work (for SPC), as summarized in Table I. Here, the 
metrics have been computed for the first 12 subjects, 
performing T1, records 14-23, involved in T2 and T3 and 
finally the results for all 22 records, enabling a comparative 
evaluation with [10], [13], [15] and [21]. We achieve a 
MAE±SDAE of 1.99±4.64, 0.86±1.86 and 1.47±3.37 for records 
1-12, 14-23 and 1-23 respectively, reflecting the improvement 
compared to state-of-the-art methodologies. The correlation 
between HRE and HRP over all records is shown in Fig. 7 (a),

shown in Fig 7 (b) and (c), demonstrating the best and the worst 
performance of CorNET over the first 12 subjects of the 
experimental cohort. It is interesting to note that MAE for 
records 14-23 is less compared to 1-12, although the former 
involves random and intense arm movements. On closer 
observation, it is evident that higher MAE (records 1-12) is 
particularly dominated by record 1 (6.23 BPM), with the initial 
phases of 1-2, 6-8 and 12-15 km/h, incurring maximal error (cf. 
Fig. 7c). An activity-wise (T1) analysis of MAE, shown in Table 
I, highlights the relatively high MAE for the first three phases, 
which recovers on the later three phases.

The motion artifacts for this subject (record 1) presents 
difficulties for the model to capture the high variance in the 
underlying data morphology, especially during the initial phase 
when the model lacks proportional representative examples to 
learn from. High variance during initial phase of the data could 
pose problems for the model to learn and adapt accordingly. 
Hence it is important to formulate a cross-validated model 
incorporating maximal variance in the training data, which we 
have performed on IMEC-Db, described in following section. 
The results for BId, (evaluated only on SPC) also shown in 
Table I, represent the average outcomes of 5-fold CV calculated 
for 20 subjects. The metrics used for evaluation are: a) 
Accuracy - ratio of correctly classified observation (subject to 
be identified) to the total observations; b) Precision - ratio of 
correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted 
positive observations; c) Recall - ratio of correctly predicted 
positive observations to all observations in actual class; d) F1 
Score - weighted average of precision and recall. We achieve 
an average accuracy, f1 score, recall, and precision of 0.96, 
0.72, 0.86 and 0.67 respectively over 20 subjects. The low f1 
score could be attributed towards the class imbalance (1:19) 
between true and rest classes. It can be observed that subjects 
10 and 20 have the best performance in terms of average 
accuracy and precision. We envisage the PPG based 
identification  to augment traditional identification systems 
(fingerprint, iris, DNA, etc.) and act as a pre-cursor to these 
traditional methods in real-life settings. 
A. Experimental Evaluation – IMEC Database (IMEC-Db) 
The ECG data (collected with chest patch) was processed 
using a CWT-based beat detection algorithm [44], deemed 
robust in ambulatory environment, to compute ground-truth 
HRE values for validation. The range (minimum and maximum) 
HRE values for both subjects varied within 55 – 118 BPM. The 
PPG data was windowed in the same manner as SPC, 8s (6s 
overlap), thereby ensuring a new HR computation every 2s. The 
PPG windows (each having an associated HRE), were split into 
completely independent training and validation datasets (ratio 
of 80%-20%). The best model chosen using five-fold cross-
validation on the training dataset was prospectively evaluated 
on the validation dataset. 
The results, in terms of MAE±SDAE and Min-Max error 
(BPM) in comparison with WFPV [13] are shown in Table II 
and a subject-specific plot highlighting HRE, HRP and WFPV is 
shown in Fig. 9. It can be observed that the errors are higher in 
comparison with SPC results (cf. Table I), which could be 
attributed to either factors – a) the IMEC-Db comprises 
naturalistic/spontaneous activities performed in an ambulant 
environment and b) reference ECG and beat detection yielding 
HRE, is prone to anomalies in an ambulant environment. 
However, CorNET framework performs better than state-of-
the-art WFPV [13] (which performs better in comparison to 
[21]). Moreover, the trend of HRP follows that of HRE and the 
range of HRP (Subject1: 58 – 103 BPM; Subject2: 77 – 109 
BPM) is inbound to that of HRE (Subject1: 55 – 118 BPM; 
Subject2: 72 – 110 BPM). Lastly the reduced error margin 
(MAE±SDAE, Min-Max) for Subject2, reflects the advantage of 
a longer training duration which helps the model to incorporate 
possible variabilities in data distribution and generalize better. 
The proposed model could be retrained periodically depending 
on the changing physiology of the subject on a longitudinal 
scale, and new model parameters hence estimated can be re-
used for the desired functionality. Initial results are motivating 
to drive future research towards longitudinal evaluation and 
hence we have analyzed the complexity of the inference mode 
aimed at real-time processing in the next sub-section.

B. Complexity Analysis  
Recent trends in remote cardiovascular disease monitoring, 
highlights the importance of ‘on-node’ processing of sensor 
data. This aids continuous/real-time monitoring, negating 
continuous data transmission and elongating the life of battery-
operated sensor nodes [45]. In such systems, it is quintessential 
to adopt low-complexity data processing strategies for energy

efficient operation of the sensor nodes. Hence, a complexity 
analysis of the proposed architecture (cf. Table III), illustrates 
the number of multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations and 
trainable parameters for each component layer. Efforts to 
reduce the trainable parameters in conjunction with a reduced 
sample size of PPG windows, by downsampling (similar to 
[13]), resulted in a degraded performance, a further testimony 
to our hyperparameter selection. Current trends in architecture 
development for DNN hold promise and make the numbers 
achievable [46-49]. Further leverage could be obtained by 
adopting an offline-online processing strategy [50], whereby the 
time and compute intensive training is carried out offline on a 
GPU and a processor/accelerator performs an online inference 
on real-time sensor data.

V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have presented a first of its kind exploration, 
for performing HR estimation and BId, reporting a personalized 
data-driven approach using DNN on wearable PPG signals 
collected in ambulatory situation. This negates the use of 
heuristics/thresholds, post-processing steps, auxiliary sensor 
data and extraction of hand-crafted features. The proposed 
CorNET topology, using two layers of CNN and LSTM is 
customized in conjunction with a dense layer for either of the 
investigated applications. We achieve an average error of 
1.47±3.37 BPM for HR on all 22 PPG recordings and an 
average accuracy of 96% for BId on all 20 subjects. The results 
could be considered favorable since to the best of knowledge, 
these represent the best accuracy in comparison to state-of-the-
art methods on the given application area. We also successfully 
evaluate CorNET on two subjects in an ambulant environment 
using custom sensors for a longer duration. The present 
exploration focusses on estimating average HR, predicting a 
new value every 2s using 8s PPG frame, thereby missing out on 
instantaneous information. Hence, we would like to extend our 
investigation towards heart rate variability measures, which 
could provide insights into functioning of the sympathetic 
nervous system and help in disease prognosis (e.g. myocardial 
infarction). Lastly, future research would focus on energy-
efficient execution of the algorithm on wearable devices in real-
time on a processor or hardware solutions (ASIC) using 
schemes proposed in [46-47].
