ABSTRACT
The utilization of photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals for
biometric identification represents a novel approach in the
area of secure authentication. PPG signals can be easily ob-
tained with low cost and have great potential to serve as bio-
metric identification mechanism. This paper explores the fea-
sibility, along with the relevant signal processing methods, of
using PPG signals of an individual as a biometric trait. PPG
signals from two biometric datasets are examined. PPG sig-
nals were obtained from the fingertips of 29 healthy subjects.
The experimental results demonstrate that PPG signals can
be used as bio-measures for identification purposes given that
PPG signals are collected under controlled environment and
with accurate sensors.

1. INTRODUCTION
In the modern automated world, access to a reliable authen-
tication system becomes essential and crucial.
Traditional
authentication methods are based on the user’s knowledge,
such as personal identification number (PIN) and passwords,
or something belonging to someone, such as smart cards and
cardkey. These methods can hardly meet the reliability re-
quirements of an automated authentication system because
identification cards can be lost or misplaced and passwords
may be forgotten.
Compared to traditional methods, biometrics can provide
enhanced security and convenience. As biometric recognition
systems are increasingly deployed for many security applica-
tions, biometrics and its applications have attracted consider-
able interests. Recently, biometrics has emerged as one of the
most reliable technologies for future human identification and
verification.
Various biometric measures have been investigated for au-
thentication purposes, including face complexion [1, 2], iris
recognition [3] and ECG [4]. These approaches present dif-
ferent level of system complexity, cost and accuracy.
In this paper, we examine the use of photoplethysmo-
graphic (PPG) signals for human identification. Compared
to other biometric approaches , PPG technique has distinct
advantages including low development cost, easy to use with-
out any complicated procedure and conveniently accessible
to various sites of human body, such as finger, ear lobe,wrist
or arm. Moreover, PPG signals provide a noninvasive and
accurate methodology to obtain valuable physiological infor-
mation such as blood oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood
flow [5].
The feasibility of applying PPG signals as a biological
discriminant has been preliminary studied [6, 7]. These stud-
ies applied an approach to represent the pulse using four
quantities: the peak number, the upward slope, the downward
slope, and the time interval from the bottom to the peak.
However, this approach ignores higher-order derivative in-
formation contained in the pulse and therefore, doesn’t take
full advantage of the pulse to improve identification accuracy
and reliability. In [8] the 1st- and 2nd- order derivatives of
a pulse signal are examined. The specific aim of this work
is to investigate the feasibility of PPG signals as a biometric
identifier in an automated way.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2
the methodology that was followed is described. Experimen-
tal results are presented in Section 3 followed by the discus-
sion in Section 4. Conclusion is in Section 5.
2. METHODOLOGY
In this section, the methodology and the procedure that was
followed are described. For each dataset (which will be dis-
cussed in detail in Section 3), the first half was used for train-
ing, where signals were pre-processed and Linear Discrim-
inant Analysis was applied to yield a set of LDA weights.
The rest of dataset was used for testing, where signals were
pre-processed and projected to LDA space following by clas-
sification with a nearest neighbor classifier.

2.1. Pre-processing
PPG pre-processing consists of the following steps:
Step 1:Peak detection
To avoid being affected by high frequency noise and im-
perfection of the signal, instead of using the zero crossing
of the first order derivative, we employ here the method pro-
posed and implemented by E. Billauer [9]. A point is con-
sidered a maximum peak if it has the local maximal value,
and is preceded (to the left) by another peak with their ampli-
tude difference larger than a preset threshold. The threshold is
manually set to be half of the average peak to peak amplitude
in the dataset. Figure 1 shows the result.
Step 2:Segmentation
After determining the maximum and minimum points
through peak detection, we define one PPG cycle as shown in
Figure 2.
Step 3:Normalization
According to our observation from all subjects’ PPG
recording, PPG amplitude can change a lot even in a short
period of time. Since it’s the PPG morphology that’s most
related to one’s identity, amplitude is normalized with respect
to the current cycle’s maximum. Figure 3 shows a PPG signal
after normalization.
Step 4:Time Domain Scaling
Since the duration of a PPG cycle is related to one’s heart
rate and can potentially increase intra-subject variability, the
duration is scaled to 200 samples to compensate for this fac-
tor. Figure 4 shows a PPG segment after scaling.
2.2. Linear Discriminant Analysis
Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA) was employed as feature
extraction tool. Linear Discriminant Analysis is a widely used
and efficient supervised learning method for dimensionality
reduction and feature extraction. Given a training set 𝒵 =

𝑚=1 is estimated by maximizing Fisher’s ratio.
This ratio is defined as the between-class to within class scat-
ter matrix. The maximization is equivalent to the solution of
the following eigenvalue problem:

where 𝜓 = [𝜓1, ..., 𝜓K], and Sb and Sw are the between

Linear Discriminant Analysis finds 𝜓 as the K most sig-
nificant eigenvectors of (S𝑊 )−1S𝑏 that correspond to the first
K largest eigenvalues.
Having obtained the basis vectors,
any test input window z is subjected to the linear projection
y = 𝜓𝑇 z.
2.3. Classification
After processing, for each subject in the dataset, the first half
of the recording was used to perform LDA training (training
set), while the second half was used for testing (testing set).
During testing, every five consecutive PPG segments are to
be projected into LDA space and compared with all the tem-
plates in galleries. Nearest neighbor and majority voting was
applied to determine if there is a match for the input signal.
Moreover, a threshold is applied to accept or reject the input
as the identified subject.
3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed ap-
proach, PPG signals from two datasets were used. Experi-
ments were carried out with identical procedure and parame-
ter settings.
∙ OpenSignal PPG Dataset: OpenSignal is a coopera-
tive repository of physiologic signals [10]. The dataset
we used, is composed of 14 healthy volunteers. Each
subject was instrumented with a finger blood volume
pulse (BVP) sensor on the 4th finger of the left hand.
bvpPLUX system [11] was used.
∙ BioSec PPG Dataset: BioSec is the Biometrics Secu-
rity Laboratory at the University of Toronto. [12]. The
dataset we used, is composed of 15 healthy volunteers.
Each subject was instrumented with a finger blood vol-
ume pulse sensor on the 2nd finger of the left hand.
NONIN pulse oximeter [13] was used.
Figure 5 and Figure 6 shows false acceptance rate and
false rejection rate versus threshold for OpenSignal and
BioSec dataset, respectively. Results for OpenSignal dataset
are better than that of Biosec dataset, as the FAR and FRR
reach 0.5% when the threshold is set properly. On the other
hand, for Biosec dataset, an Equal Error Rate of 25% is
achievable, and the threshold can be set differently to get
lower FRR with an increasing in FAR, which is applicable in
low security systems or multi-modal biometric systems.
4. DISCUSSION
Although identical algorithm and parameters were used for
simulation in both datasets, there is a significant difference
in the performance. In order to examine the inter-class and
intra-class variance, all PPG segments in the testing set are

Fig. 9. Comparison of sample signals from both datasets
projected to LDA space which reduce the dimensionality to
14 for OpenSignal dataset and 15 for BioSec dataset. Further-
more, in order to visualize in two dimensional plot, Principle
Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to each testing set
and the first two coefficients were used to plot the correspond-
ing data point in a two dimensional space. Data clusters for
OpenSignal dataset and BioSec dataset are shown in Figure
7 and Figure 8, respectively. To make a clear demonstration,
only 7 subjects are shown on the plots, with 10 sample data
points randomly drawn from the testing set for each subject.
As shown on the cluster plots, samples from BioSec
dataset exhibits less intra-class similarity and inter-class vari-
ance, which made the classification task difficult. We also
observed this difference in time domain, where signals from
Biosec dataset are relatively unstable in signal morphology,
as shown in Figure 9.
Possible sources of the difference
may come from the device, sensor and recording conditions.
Moreover, according to the experimental results with the sub-
jects from the two datasets, it is better to obtain PPG signals
in a controlled environment. In the case that PPG signals are
not stable, they should be combined with another biometric
signal. For instance, ECG could be recorded simultaneously
with PPG and provide multi-modal biometric identification
system.
5. CONCLUSION
This paper examines the feasibility of PPG signals for bio-
metric identification mechanisms. Experiments point out that
these signals are vulnerable since the equipment that is used
and the recording environment are crucial, and have great
impact on the biometric authentication system performance.
However, it is possible to identify a person by information
extracted from PPG signals given that signals were collected
under controlled environment and with accurate sensors.
