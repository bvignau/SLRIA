Abstract - In the recent years, automated security systems 
have become one of the major concerns. Secure and reliable 
authentication of a person is in great demand. In this paper, we 
propose the applicability of Photoplethysmograph (PPG) signal 
for human identification. Fourier series analysis and Semi 
Discrete Decomposition methods are applied to extract the 
features that appear to offer excellent discrimination among 
subjects. The main obstacle while analysing a PPG signal is the 
presence of noise, contaminated by motion artifact. The proposed 
method exhibits good identification accuracies not just with the 
normal PPG signals, but also with the motion artifact PPG signal.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Biometrics is a science of identifying a person using his 
physiological 
and/or 
behavioural 
characteristics[1]. 
Traditional biometrics like fingerprint[4], palmprint[13], 
face[8] and iris[5] have common weakness in their 
vulnerability to spoofing and even some of the other traits can 
be used if the person is dead. Such problems can be solved 
using signals like EEG[9], ECG[11] and PPG[2]. PPG signals 
have been used extensively in clinical diagnosis for many 
years. It has been recently suggested by the research 
communities that PPG signal can also be used as a biometric 
for human identification recognition. Most of the PPG 
biometrics work reported earlier [6][14]assumed that the PPG 
signal is free from motion artifact. 
In most environments the PPG signal is contaminated by 
motion artifact and surrounding light variation luring 
recordings. Changes in surrounding light can be rejected using 
the emission of modulation of signals from an infrared emitter. 
The most troublesome problem with PPG signal while 
developing an authentication system is the motion artifact. 
These artifacts arise mainly as a result of the air gap between 
the sensor and the skin which leads to poor estimation of 
physiological parameters from the recording. Motion artifact 
is mainly low frequency interference and it is random in 
nature. Even a slight movement by the subject while recording 
would then invariably disturb the contact between the sensor 
and the subject’s body, corresponding the PPG signal obtained 
during such periods to be corrupt with motion artifacts.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 
deals with theoretical framework and section 3 presents the 
methodology. Section 4 presents the results & discussion. 
Finally, Section 5 contains the conclusion. 
II. 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 
 
A. Fundamentals of PPG Signal 
 
PPG signals provide a non-invasive and accurate 
methodology to obtain valuable physiological information 
such as blood oxygen saturation, heart rate and blood flow.  
The blood in human body is being pumped from the heart 
to all parts in the body by blood vessels called arteries. Blood 
pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the 
arteries. Each time the heart beats it pumps out a considerable 
volume of blood to the arteries. Systolic pressure which is the 
highest blood pressure occurs when heart is in pumping 
motion. Diastolic pressure is lowest blood pressure when heart 
is in resting[7].Since blood pressures are an indirect 
measurement of heart beats and the blood pressure tends to 
change according to the time and emotion. For instance, blood 
pressure will rise when a subject is awaken and excited. The 
unit for measurement of blood pressure is in mmHg and the 
notation will be systolic followed by diastolic pressure. The 
Photoplethysmograph (PPG) signals reflect the change in 
blood volume caused by blood vessel expansion and

contraction, which can be detected by photodiode if external 
light is illuminated into tissue. This method is based on the 
idea that if an external applied pressure in the cuff is equal to 
the arterial pressure instantaneously, the arterial walls will be 
unloaded (zero transmural pressure) and the arteries will not 
change in size. In this condition, the blood volume will not 
change. 
The Photoplethysmographic sensor used to read a PPG 
signal has an infrared emitter and photodiode detector. The 
intensity of light from infrared emitter which reaches the 
photodiode detector in either reflection or transmission will be 
measured to determine the blood volume changes. The 
Photoplethysmographic sensor will be placed below the tip of 
the finger and pressure will be applied on the proximal 
phalanx. Since the cuff is wrapped on the proximal phalanx of 
the finger rather than arm, it makes less discomfort for 
prolonged use. The blood volume changes on the finger will 
be notified by the sensor and transmitted to the system by 
wired or bluetooth transmitter. There will be a timer attached 
on the device to time the cuff pressure applied time and 
transmitter so that it is semi-continuous measurement. This is 
because to decrease the energy consumption of Bluetooth 
transmission and to avoid discomfort of the subject’s finger 
due to continuous pressure applied.  
The idea of the blood pressure sensor is much like the 
Photoplethysmograph Fingernail Sensor for measurement of 
finger force which is mentioned by Stephen A. Mascaro and 
H. Harry Asada [14]. The finger force is measuring 
colouration 
of 
fingernail 
by 
using 
reflectance 
Photoplethysmography. A sample PPG signal waveform 
extracted from the above Finger nail sensor under normal 
condition is shown in Figure 1 .

B. Fourier Series Analysis 
A periodic function f(t) can be represented by an infinite 
sum of sine and/or cosine functions that are harmonically 
related. That is, the frequency of any trigonometric term in the 
infinite series is an integral multiple, or harmonic, of the 
fundamental frequency of the periodic function[10]. Thus, 
given f(t) is periodic (e.g. square wave, triangular wave, half 
rectified wave,etc.), then f(t) can be represented as follows: 
���� � �� � ∑
���
�
���
cos������ � ��sin �������            (1) 
where k is the integer sequence 1,2,3,...........∞ 
a0,ak and bk are called the Fourier coefficients, and are 
calculated from f(t),ω0 = 2π/T is the fundamental frequency of 
the periodic function f(t) with period T, and  kω0 is known as 
k-th harmonic of f(t). 
a0,ak and bk can be calculated as follows

The Pre-processing section to be used in methodology uses 
the above mentioned method to reconstruct the original PPG 
signal from the contaminated PPG signal based on a cycle to 
cycle basis. 
C. Semi Discrete Decomposition  
Dimension reduction refers to the process of taking a data-
set with a number of dimensions, and then creating a new 
data-set with a fewer number of dimensions, which are meant 
to capture only those dimensions that are in some sense 
important. The idea here is that we want to preserve as much 
structure of data as possible, while reducing the number of 
dimensions it possesses; therefore we are creating a lower 
dimensional approximation of data. 
We have used Semi Discrete Decomposition (SDD) 
algorithm for reducing the dimensions. The primary advantage 
of SDD approximations over other types of matrix 
approximations such as SVD is that it typically provides a 
more accurate approximation for far less storage. The SDD 
approximation of an m x n matrix A is a decomposition of the 
form 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
         (5) 
Here each xi is an m-vector with entries from the set δ = { -
1 , 0,+1 }, each yi is an n-vector with the entries from the set δ 
, and each di is a positive scalar. We call this a k-term SDD 
approximation. 
III. METHODOLOGY 
A. Experimental Setup 
PPG data from 8 different subjects were used in this study. 
The data were collected by Andrews Samraj and Shoel 
Sayeed[8] 
recorded 
at 
Multimedia 
University(MMU), 
Malaysia. The description of the data and the recording 
procedure are as follows. The PPG signals were recorded 
using a Pulse Oximetry module (from Dolphin Medical, Inc) 
that was connected to a computer using a data acquisition 
software and captured with a sampling frequency of 37 Hz[12] 
as shown in Figure 2 . The main purpose of sampling the 
signal at this particular frequency is to highlight that even at 
this lowest frequency it is possible to c

The values of Fourier coefficients of higher order ( k > 7)  
diminish drastically as shown in Table 1 and Table 2. Figure 6 
shows the reconstructed PPG signal using the first 7 
significant Fourier coefficients. 
 
Figure 6. Reconstructed PPG Waveform from Fourier Co-efficients 
When the subject moves while recording the signal, it 
results to contaminated signal. The contaminated signal say 
fc(t) will contain an additional component due to motion 
artifact. The contaminated signal can be represented as   
fc(t) = f(t) + fa(t)                                                                    (8) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
( 
where f(t) is the original artifact free PPG signal and fa(t) is 
the motion artifact signal. Now Fourier series coefficients are 
calculated for the nth cycle of fc(t) by the following mentioned 
equations

Since a PPG signal has a very little correlation with the 
motion artifact signal, they can be assumed to be independent 
to each other. Hence the terms 
�

�����

can be evaluated to be zero. Hence under this condition we 
will have  
nakc = nak  & nbkc = nbk                                                          (12) 
In general the motion artifacts are random in nature and 
can be assumed to have zero mean value. From equation 3.2.4, 
the artifact fa(t) has no DC value then na0c = na0. Thus by 
reconstructing the PPG signal from the computed Fourier 
series coefficients of the corrupted PPG signal, we obtain the 
error free PPG signal. 
C. Feature Extraction & Selection Strategies 
Each recordings of the PPG signal, which is represented in 
the form of a matrix A  is of order n by m, where n is the 
number of LED’s and m is the number of sequential samples 
per unit time  in our experiment n was fixed as 4 and m was 
taken up to 1 second. After applying SDD ,  matrix A can 
represented as follows 
A = XkDkYk
T                                                                          (13)  
where Xk  is n x k matrix , Dk is k x k matrix and matrix and 
Yk
T is k x m matrix. Each row of X corresponds to a row of A 
and each column of YT corresponds to a column of A. The 
diagonal entries of D, provides information about the 
importance of each of the components. 
The actual average size of matrix A is (3,056). After the 
application of SDD the features are reduced to 764. Let F 
represents the feature vector. For computational reasons, it 
may be more efficient to remove several features at a time at 
the expense of classification accuracy. Depending on the 
requirements of the system complexity, two selection 
strategies can be adopted 
1.  Strategy One   
The first p values of the sorted feature vector F were used 
as features. Therefore the entire signal A is now represented 
by a highly discriminate feature vector of length F(P). These p 
largest values of F contain the feature component of each

subject which can be used to discriminate from others. 
Throughout the experiment, to reduce the complexity of 
computation we set the value of p to be 5. Hence the reduced 
feature vector can now be represented as 
F1 =[a1,…………..,a5]                                                       (14) 
2.   Strategy Two 
The first q components of F were used as features for 
matching purpose. The value of q’s differ from subject to 
subject but finally when normalised, the values should result 
to uniqueness. Here the reduced feature vector can be 
represented as  
F2 = [a1,…,aq]

So obtained feature vector F1 and F2 can be used further 
for matching and classification. 
D. Classification 
We first generate a matching score by the selected feature 
compared with the stored template. For each PPG signal, the 
Euclidean’s distance is calculated and is compared with the set 
of samples stored in the system is computed. The template 
resulting in the smallest distance is considered to be the match. 
The Euclidean distance between two points x and y can be 
calculated as 
��� � ��� � |� � �|                                                           (17) 
IV. 
 RESULTS & DISCUSSION 
Figure 7 Shows the Euclidean’s distance calculated 
between the referenced PPG data of a subject and eight other 
recordings of the same subject using the feature vector F1of 
the strategy one. Table 3 shows the results in terms of 
Euclidean’s distance calculated between the referenced PPG 
data of a subject and eight other recordings of the same subject 
using the feature vector F2 of strategy two and the same is 
shown in Figure 8. On comparisons we clearly find that 
strategy two results in a better classification, where-in the intra 
subject variations are very less in terms for Euclidean’s 
distance.

Figure 9 and Figure 10 shows the Euclidean’s distance 
between the referenced PPG of subject 1 with three different 
recordings of subject 2 using strategy one and strategy two as 
discussed earlier, here we can find a huge gap between their 
distances in the second strategy rather than the first strategy, 
this can be used as an improvement factor in using PPG signal 
as a biometric component in classifying individuals.

V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have presented a novel approach to select 
the best set of features to efficiently identify individuals using 
PPG data. Our approach is based on relevant component 
normalisation from the feature vector. Experimental results 
show clearly the efficiency of this method.
