Abstract:
Biometric systems allow recognition and verification of an individual through his
or her physiological or behavioral characteristics. It is a growing field of research due to the
increasing demand for secure and trustworthy authentication systems. Compressed sensing is a
data compression acquisition method that has been proposed in recent years. The sampling and
compression of data is completed synchronously, avoiding waste of resources and meeting the
requirements of small size and limited power consumption of wearable portable devices. In this
work, a compression reconstruction method based on compression sensing was studied using
bioelectric signals, which aimed to increase the limited resources of portable remote bioelectric signal
recognition equipment. Using electrocardiograms (ECGs) and photoplethysmograms (PPGs) of
heart signals as research data, an improved segmented weak orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)
algorithm was developed to compress and reconstruct the signals. Finally, feature values were
extracted from the reconstructed signals for identification and analysis. The accuracy of the proposed
method and the practicability of compression sensing in cardiac signal identification were verified.
Experiments showed that the reconstructed ECG and PPG signal recognition rates were 95.65% and
91.31%, respectively, and that the residual value was less than 0.05 mV, which indicates that the
proposed method can be effectively used for two bioelectric signal compression reconstructions.

1. Introduction
In recent years, with the development of embedded and wireless network communication
technologies, many wearable and portable cardiac signal acquisition devices have emerged, making
it increasingly less difficult to detect signals. Cardiac signals have also been widely used in various
fields, and the identification technology based on cardiac signals has become a research hot spot [1,2].
However, difficulty lies in combining the remote identification technology of heart signals with
portable heart signal acquisition equipment to simultaneously improve the accuracy and convenience
of identification and meet the requirements of identification systems regarding efficiency and accuracy.
Compressed sensing (CS) is a new sampling theory that uses a fixed set of linear measurements together
with a nonlinear recovery process. CS aims to reconstruct signals and images from significantly
fewer measurements. The characteristic of compressed sensing [3,4] is that its sampling and data
compression are synchronously completed, avoiding the collection of a large amount of redundant
information, reducing the complexity of the data, and improving the compression performance of
the data. The application of compressed sensing technology to portable cardiac signal identification

devices can alleviate the problem of generating a large amount of redundant data during cardiac
signal acquisition, thereby reducing the occupied storage space and energy consumption [5,6] of data
transmission and improving the performance of portable devices.
Traditional strategies for identification rely on entities (tokens or ID cards) or passwords. However,
such strategies are based on something that the user knows or possesses and are thus vulnerable
to security attacks. Biometrics are characteristics extracted directly from human subjects to form
signatures for identity verification systems. By designing an authentication key to be highly correlated
to physiological or behavioral features of an individual’s identity, this class of strategies offers airtight
security. Several biometric modalities have been used so far, among which are fingerprints, face, voice,
keystroke, and gait. Although most of them have gained wide acceptance, the main limitation in their
application is their defenselessness against falsification. Lately, attention has been given to employing
a new biometric trait: the electrocardiogram (ECG). ECG signals reflect cardiac electrical activity and
have been well studied for medical diagnostic purposes. The idea of identifying subjects by ECG is
relatively new, but it has considerable advantages. The key benefit is the robustness against falsified
credentials, as it is difficult to steal an ECG and impossible to mimic it. In addition, an ECG itself is a
liveness indicator, which suggests that potential applications will need to ensure that the subject who
is offering the biometric is indeed the one who is carrying it. This is not the case with conventional
biometrics such as fingerprints, irises, and faces, which are deficient in situations where additional
mechanisms are needed to guarantee liveness [7]. Human recognition based on ECG signals is a
relatively new and rapidly developing method [8]. Compared with the human face, fingerprints, irises,
and other biological features, heart telecommunication signals have the advantages of ensuring that
there is a living body, ease of collection, difficulty of being stolen, and so forth, which is why they have
gained an increasing amount of attention in the field of identification.
In this work, we mainly studied a cardiac signal reconstruction method based on compressed
sensing. We focused on ECGs and photoplethysmograms (PPGs) in cardiac signals. In the phase
of signal reconstruction, the stagewise weak orthogonal matching pursuit (SWOMP) algorithm was
improved to enhance the accuracy and stability of reconstruction. Finally, the eigenvalues of the
reconstructed cardiac signals were extracted for identification, and the accuracy of the proposed method
and the practicality of compressed sensing in cardiac signal identification were analyzed, providing
support for cardiac signals for identification. In summary, we made the following major contributions:
•
Research on a preprocessing method of ECG signals based on the wavelet transform algorithm
of coif3 function. This method can effectively remove noise and provide a clean ECG signal for
subsequent ECG signal processing with low computational complexity.
•
Study of ECG and PPG signals feature extraction based on discrete wavelet transform.
After denoising the signal by wavelet transform, the wave bands of different frequency segments
are located by setting the corresponding threshold and the value window. Finally, each waveform
is located. The algorithm can effectively extract the features of ECG and PPG signals.
•
Research on ECG and PPG signals compression and reconstruction based on compressed sensing.
The sparsity of ECG and PPG signals was studied, and an improved reconstruction algorithm was
designed. The proposed method was used to compress and reconstruct the ECG and PPG signals,
and the reconstruction time and data error under different conditions were obtained, providing
support for practical application.
•
With the standardized reconstruction error calculation method and signal reconstruction time as
the evaluation index, the reconstruction algorithm was comprehensively analyzed. ECG data of
the same lead were used to reduce the influence of uncertainty factors on the results.
This article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces some of the most relevant related works
that can be found in the literature. Section 3 mainly considers the compression reconstruction of
two bioelectrical signals (ECG and PPG) using compression sensing technology, the design of the
reconstruction algorithm, and an analysis of its performance. Section 4 introduces the application of
compressed sensing in bioelectric signal recognition, the feature extraction method of two kinds of

signals, and the classifier used for signal recognition. Section 5 describes the simulation experiments
performed to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. Finally, Section 6 summarizes the paper
and proposes future work directions.

years, the application of compression sensing in cardiac signal acquisition has gradually
become a popular research direction among scholars, which has provided many research results.
Hossein Mamaghanian et al. [11] applied compressed sensing to a multilead ECG acquisition system

The experimental results show that the algorithm has a high compression ratio and minimal data
distortion. Zamani H et al. [14] used the block K-singular value decomposition (BK-SVD) algorithm
to train a block sparse dictionary for PPG signals, and then used the block sparse Bayesian learning
(BSBL) algorithm to recover the PPG signals using block sparse information.
Biometric systems allow recognition and verification of an individual through his or her
physiological or behavioral characteristics. It is a growing field of research due to the increasing
demand for secure and trustworthy authentication systems. Bioidentification technology based on
heart signals is an important research direction in the field of identification. Several studies have shown
that cardiac-signal-based biometrics are feasible, and most research has been on biometric applications
in its central electrical signal (ECG). Biel et al. [15] first proposed the feasibility of studying ECGs
as biometrics. Hejazi M et al. [16] used kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) to extract the
dimensionality features of ECG signals and classified them by support vector machine (SVM). Similarly,
the literature shows the feasibility of PPG signals in the field of biometrics. Petros Spachos et al. [17]
performed pulse (PPG) signal acquisition on the fingertips of 29 healthy subjects. The signals were
preprocessed and projected into the LDA space, then the nearest-neighbor classifier was used for
classification, verifying the feasibility of PPG as a biometric. A. Reit Kavsaolu et al. [18] used a
second-derivative PPG (SDPPG) data card to collect 10 s of PPG signals from five healthy subjects and
extracted 20 new features from each of them over a period of time. The features of the 20 PPG signals
did not change, and the k-nearest-neighbor (K-NN) classifier was used to achieve a 95% recognition
success rate with 10 new features of 10× cross-validation. Yathav et al. [19] developed a system called
miBEAT that can simultaneously collect ECG and PPG signals and can be used on smartphones or
tablets for signal acquisition and personal identification or authentication.
3. Heart Signal Processing Based on Compressed Sensing
3.1. Data Collection
This study focused on identification technology of cardiac signals based on compressed sensing,
taking ECG and PPG signals in cardiac signals as the research objects. Acquisition of both cardiac
signals was achieved via an AD8232-based [20] ECG acquisition module and a photoplethysmography
module. Among them, the ECG acquisition module collected the chest ECG through lead I, and PPG
signal acquisition was realized through the photoplethysmography sensor on the fingertip. In total,
there were 23 subjects, including 15 males and 8 females, whose ages ranged between 23 and 25 years.
A sampling frequency of 500 Hz was used.
3.2. Sparse Transform and Measurement Matrix Design
The sparseness of the signal was the prerequisite for the application of compression perception.
The purpose of sparse signal representation is to concentrate the main information in the signal on

as few nonzero coefficients as possible, simplifying the solution process. Commonly used sparse
signal representation methods have different orthogonal basis functions and redundant dictionaries.
In recent years, redundant dictionaries have been a research hot spot for the sparse decomposition
of signals. There are two main ways to construct redundant dictionaries: (1) manual design and
(2) dictionary training. Firstly, the construction method and sparse performance of the orthogonal
basis function and redundant dictionary were studied. Discrete cosine transform (DCT) [21] and a
K-SVD [22] redundant dictionary were used to determine the sparse representation method suitable
for cardiac signals. The measurement matrix was chosen as the Gaussian measurement matrix, and to
eliminate its randomness, the experimental results were averaged over the results of 10 runs.
The K-SVD redundant dictionary of ECG and PPG signals was constructed to simulate the
experiment and compared with the DCT sparse basis. The collected ECG and PPG signals were used
as experimental data. Firstly, 1,024,000 sampling points were collected as a sample set for dictionary
construction, and the whole sample set was divided into atoms of length N (N = 1024). The initial
dictionary (dictionary D) was composed of K = 800 atoms, and dictionary D was determined by the
K-SVD algorithm. After training, the trained redundant dictionary D was obtained as an experimental
dictionary. Then, the data containing at least 1024 sample points were collected as the original signal,
the redundancy dictionary and the DCT sparse basis were used for sparseness, and the performance
of the two sparse modes was analyzed and compared. In the comparison experiments of the two
compression sensing methods, a random Gaussian measurement matrix and an orthogonal matching
pursuit (OMP) reconstruction algorithm were used. For convenience of representation, the two
methods were respectively recorded as DCT + OMP and K-SVD + OMP. As shown in Figure 1a,b,
the experimental results of the ECG in the DCT + OMP and K-SVD + OMP compression reconstruction
modes are shown in the compression ratio. Figure 2a,b shows the experimental results of PPG under
DCT + OMP and K-SVD + OMP compression reconstruction modes in the compression ratio.

Figures 1 and 2 show that the use of the DCT + OMP algorithm for ECG signal and pulse signal
compression reconstruction resulted in serious distortion, while the use of the K-SVD + OMP algorithm
for compression reconstruction of the two signals was significantly better than the former. Intuitively,
the signal with less distortion represents the ideal reconstruction effect.
3.3. Refactoring Algorithm Design
In compressed sensing, the reconstruction quality of a signal is not only related to the selection of
the measurement matrix but also to the reconstruction algorithm of the signal. A good reconstruction
algorithm can more closely approximate the original signal and reduce the error before and after
reconstruction. In this study, we mainly considered the SWOMP algorithm and improved it.
3.3.1. Stagewise Weak Orthogonal Matching Pursuit Algorithm
The SWOMP algorithm [23] is an extension of the OMP algorithm, which selects the optimal
atom for changing the index set according to the requirements of the inner product criterion metric.
Unlike the OMP algorithm, only one maximum value is selected from the correlation vector at a
time. SWOMP sets a threshold value when selecting an atom. Each iteration selects an atom greater
than or equal to the threshold in the correlation vector and selects the corresponding atomic index.
Incorporating atoms into the index set and support set improves the efficiency of the refactoring.
In addition, SWOMP is also different from the stagewise orthogonal matching pursuit (StOMP)
algorithm [24]. When selecting an atom, the selection of the threshold value is related to the residual
coefficient by using the "weak selection" method, which reduces the requirement for the measurement
matrix. Moreover, the OMP algorithm needs to input the sparsity k as a priori information, but the
sparsity k value is often difficult to obtain. The SWOMP algorithm does not need the sparsity k value,
and the signal can be reconstructed by setting the appropriate threshold and the number of iterations.
Therefore, the SWOMP algorithm has a comparative advantage when reconstructing cardiac signals.
The reconstruction steps of the SWOMP algorithm are as follows.

(3) Update the index set and the support set; let Λk = Λk−1 ∪ J0 and Ak = Ak−1 ∪ ϕJ0. If Λk = Λk−1, stop
iteration, and turn to Step (6).

(6) Output sparse signal.
Here, α has a value range of 0 < α ≤ 1 and the threshold Th = αmax�abs(u)�, φJ0 represents the
atom of the corresponding index set in the measurement matrix, and ˆθ is the reconstructed sparse
signal. In order to verify the reconstruction performance of SWOMP, the redundant dictionary was
selected as the sparse representation, the Gaussian random measurement matrix was used to observe
the signal, and the SWOMP algorithm was used to reconstruct the signal. Figure 3a,b shows the
reconstruction effects of the ECG and PPG signals under the SWOMP algorithm, respectively. The CSR
of the ECG signal was 0.7 with a threshold value of α = 0.83; the CSR of the PPG signal was 0.5, with a

threshold value of α = 0.7. It can be seen from the figure, before and after reconstruction, that the
characteristics of the ECG and PPG signals were basically retained without obvious distortion.

However, the SWOMP algorithm also has some defects. The SWOMP algorithm selects the 
atomic update support set according to the established threshold value 𝛼, and the number of 
iterations S also needs to be artificially set. These two values are usually set empirically, which makes 
the SWOMP algorithm quite unstable. Because, usually, the choice of 𝛼 value has a great influence 
on the reconstruction effect of the algorithm, if the value of 𝛼 is too large (small), the number of 
selected atoms will be too small (more), which will result in poor signal reconstruction. Similarly, the 
selection of iterations number S also has an effect on the number of atoms selected. Moreover, the 
SWOMP algorithm selects multiple atoms larger than the threshold value at one time, unlike the 
OMP algorithm, which selects the best matching atom at one time. Although the reconstruction 
efficiency is improved and the requirement for the measurement matrix is reduced, the accuracy of 
reconstruction decreases when the selected atoms are not particularly suitable. So, the SWOMP 
algorithm needs further improvement in terms of atomic number selection. 
3.3.2. Improved Stagewise Weak Orthogonal Matching Pursuit Algorithm 
First, two propositions are given:

(RIP) with the parameter (𝑘, 𝛿�), if 𝑘� � 𝑘, then �𝛷��
� 𝑌�� �
����
����� ‖𝑌‖� is the true proposition [25].

� 𝑌�� ≤
����
����� ‖𝑌‖�,
then 𝑘� ≤ 𝑘 is also a true proposition. 
Here, 𝑘� is the estimated sparse value, k is the actual sparse value, 𝛬�  is the index set 
corresponding to 𝑘�  atoms, (∙)�  is the transpose of (∙) , and 𝛷��  is the set of atoms in the
corresponding index set 𝛬� in the measurement matrix. 
According to Proposition 2, an initial sparsity estimate 𝑘� is obtained, and 𝑘� is selected as the 
initial minimum value of the atom. If the initial number of selected atoms is less than 𝑘�, the modified 
threshold value 𝛼 is reselected to the atom, ensuring the minimum value of the selected atom [26]. 
At the same time, combined with the idea of the sparsity adaptive matching pursuit (SAMP) 
algorithm [27], the algorithm can iterate adaptively according to the initial step size and initial 
residual. It is no longer necessary to set the iteration number S according to the empirical value. The 
iterative process is divided into several stages, and the phased selection of atoms in the support set 
is achieved according to the step size. As the iteration proceeds, the step size is updated and the 
support set is expanded. The iteration termination condition of the new algorithm is that the number 
of atoms in the support set will reach a certain number 𝑆���. In order to prevent the number of atoms

k0 ≤ k is also a true proposition.
Here, k0 is the estimated sparse value, k is the actual sparse value, Λ0 is the index set corresponding
to k0 atoms, (·)T is the transpose of (·), and ΦΛ0 is the set of atoms in the corresponding index set Λ0 in
the measurement matrix.
According to Proposition 2, an initial sparsity estimate k0 is obtained, and k0 is selected as the
initial minimum value of the atom. If the initial number of selected atoms is less than k0, the modified
threshold value α is reselected to the atom, ensuring the minimum value of the selected atom [26]. At the
same time, combined with the idea of the sparsity adaptive matching pursuit (SAMP) algorithm [27],
the algorithm can iterate adaptively according to the initial step size and initial residual. It is no
longer necessary to set the iteration number S according to the empirical value. The iterative process is
divided into several stages, and the phased selection of atoms in the support set is achieved according
to the step size. As the iteration proceeds, the step size is updated and the support set is expanded.

The iteration termination condition of the new algorithm is that the number of atoms in the support set
will reach a certain number Smax. In order to prevent the number of atoms from being overselected,
and to ensure the reconstruction accuracy, a number of reconstruction experiments were performed on
ECG and PPG signals. From the experiments, it was found that the accuracy of reconstruction can be
guaranteed when the maximum number of atoms does not exceed M/2. So, the maximum number of
atoms was selected as M/2 in the improved algorithm and Smax = M/2 (M was the measured number).
At the same time, after the atoms were selected at the threshold, the atoms were arranged in descending
order to ensure that the most-matched atomic value was selected in the first place, so as to improve the
reconstruction accuracy of the algorithm.
The steps of the improved sparsity weak adaptive matching pursuit (SWAMP) are as follows.

In order to more accurately compare the performance of these two reconstruction algorithms,
a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was introduced as an evaluation index [28]. The SNR is defined in
Equation (1):
SNR = −20 log10
||x − ˆx||2
||x||2

where x is the original signal and ˆx is the reconstructed signal. At the same time, the SWAMP and
SWOMP algorithms were simulated and analyzed. The experiment followed the previous data,
choosing the redundant dictionary as the sparse representation and the Gaussian random measurement
matrix as the observation matrix. The range of the threshold was [0.60, 0.95], the compression ratio
was 0.7, and the sparsity k was 100. To reduce the effect of the uncertainty of the random measurement
matrix, the average was determined from 20 repetitions of the process. Figure 4a,b shows the number
of atoms selected by the SWAMP and SWOMP algorithms under different threshold values. It can
be seen from Figure 4a,b that when the threshold is small, the SWOMP algorithm excessively selects
atoms; when the threshold is large, the SWOMP algorithm selects fewer atoms. Because the maximum

stable, which is within the range of the maximum number of atoms specified by the algorithm.

It can be seen from Figure 6 that, because the threshold value was corrected and the minimum
atomic selection value k was selected, the SWAMP algorithm’s run time was increased compared
with the SWOMP algorithm, but the difference was not large. The run time was fast compared with
the OMP algorithm, which ensured the reconstruction efficiency of the algorithm. At the same time,
the SWAMP algorithm was more stable than the SWOMP algorithm, and the reconstruction accuracy
was also improved. So, the SWAMP algorithm had better reconstruction performance.
4. Identification Based on Biological Electrical Signals
Human identification is essentially a pattern recognition problem involving three main steps:
preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. Preprocessing can be regarded as a noise and
artifact removal step. Feature extraction operates directly on the Alternating Current (AC) of a few
seconds of ECG to form distinctive personalized signatures for every subject. As in most pattern
recognition problems, classification among a gallery set is the last step of the identification process.
Based on the compressed sensing processing of ECG and PPG signals, this part preprocesses, extracts,
and classifies the two signals separately and compares the feature extraction and recognition effects of
the signals before and after reconstruction.
4.1. Signal Noise and Pretreatment
Raw ECG data contain a considerable amount of noise that has to be eliminated. The most
common types of noise in ECGs are baseline wander and powerline interference [29]. Baseline wander
is caused by low-frequency components that force the signal to extend away from the isoelectric line.
The source of this kind of artifact is respiration, body movement, or inadequate electrode attachment.
Furthermore, powerline interference is generated by poor grounding or conflicts with nearby devices.
Hejazi M [16] et al. denoised ECG signals by wavelet transform. Experiments have shown that wavelet
transform based on the coif3 function has a better denoising effect. In this study, the two signals were
preprocessed using the same method. First, preliminary denoising was performed by a high-pass filter
hardware circuit, then denoising was performed by a wavelet transform algorithm based on the coif3
function. It (wavelet transform) can analyze the time domain and frequency domain of the signal at
the same time.
4.2. Feature Extraction
In the process of heart signal recognition, it is necessary to locate and extract feature points
and feature vectors after signal preprocessing, and the extracted feature vectors are used as the
basis for recognition. Feature extraction of ECG signals is performed by means of discrete wavelet
transform [30]. Wavelet transform can decompose the signal in the frequency and time domains by
changing the frequency and position of a waveform, which satisfies the requirements of different
resolutions in the time and frequency domains. The window size by wavelet transform varies—it is
wide at low frequencies and narrow at high frequencies, and so is applicable to all frequency bands.
An important application of wavelet analysis is its ability to process and compute data in compressed
parameters, which are often referred to as features. The different frequency bands can be analyzed
using discrete wavelet transform, where the signal is decomposed into an approximation and detail
coefficients. The main advantages of the discrete wavelet transform are its robustness and flexibility
for nonstationary ECG data analysis. The morphological characteristics of ECG signals have different
peak amplitudes, peak intervals, and QRS complexes. The feature extraction method of wavelet
transform was used to detect different peaks of ECG signals. After denoising the signal by wavelet
transform, the corresponding threshold was set according to the characteristics of the transformed
wavelet coefficients, so as to locate the QRS, P-wave, T-wave [31], as well as the starting and ending
points of the P-wave and T-wave (denoted as PB, PE, TB, and TE).
Figure 7 shows the extraction of ECG signal reference points. The distance and amplitude between
each base point were calculated by numerical operation, and they were formed into eigenvectors.

Independent classification of the subject’s heart rate required normalization of the 15 distance features
using the average RR [17,32,33] distance of all subjects in the training group. The 15 range and six
amplitude characteristics of ECGs are shown in Table 3. Figure 8 shows the ECG signal feature
extraction diagram, in which the detected QRS band, PT, as well as the starting and ending positions of
the PT band are annotated.

Compared with the extraction of feature points and feature vectors of ECGs, the extraction of 
reference points and feature vectors of PPG signals is relatively less common. At present, reference

After extracting the features of signals, identification and classification were carried out. Because 
biological data is nonlinear, the SVM is considered to be the most suitable classifier among biometric 
classifiers based on ECG features [36]. At the same time, the SVM algorithm is suitable for being 
embedded into hardware modules [37,38], making the system compact and convenient.  
SVM is a binary classifier, and biometrics require multiple classifications. In this work, the one-
to-one SVM [39] was used to classify the signals for identification purposes. The kernel function 
selected was the Gaussian kernel function Radial Basis Function (RBF), which is the most effective 
and commonly used method for ECG signal recognition with SVM [40]. The performance of an SVM 
classifier based on the RBF kernel function is generally affected by two parameters: penalty coefficient 
C, and RBF function parameter gamma [41]. The appropriate parameters were selected by cross-
validating 10 times. In the training phase, the feature extracted from the test sample was input into 
an SVM classifier based on the RBF kernel function to obtain an SVM model, and an independent 
classifier was trained between each two individuals. In this study, there were 23 subjects, so 253 
classifiers needed to be trained, and the most votes were used as the recognition results.

It can be seen from Table 4 that the RMSE after reconstruction was kept at a small value, the SNR
was large enough, and the error before and after signal reconstruction was small. However, the signal
reconstruction effect was not the same. The analysis showed that the quality of the acquired signal had a
certain influence on the reconstruction effect. The smaller the signal noise, the better the reconstruction
effect. At the same time, the uncertainty of the random measurement matrix also had a certain influence
on the experimental results.
In the feature extraction and recognition stage, the practicability of compressed sensing in the
identification of biological heart signals was analyzed by comparing the difference of the feature
value and the change of the recognition rate before and after reconstruction. Firstly, a segment of the
signal containing 1024 sampling points was selected as S1, and the S1 signal was compressed and
reconstructed to obtain signal S2. Then, the S1 and S2 signals were extracted by wavelet transform,
and the obtained eigenvalues were compared. A comparison between the ECG and PPG signals before
and after reconstruction is shown in Figure 12a,b. ECG signals were extracted from a set of 21 features
for the individual with recording number 101, and from a set of 12 features for the pulse signal with
recording number 111.

training sample via the method described above, and the data were normalized and sent to the SVM

and the final output recognition results were 95.65% before and after ECG signal reconstruction and
91.31% before and after pulse signal reconstruction, with the same recognition rate before and after
reconstruction. This indicated the effectiveness of the method proposed above for two kinds of cardiac
signal compression reconstruction and the practicality of using it for cardiac signal classification
and recognition.
6. Conclusions
In this work, we studied the compression and reconstruction methods of cardiac signals based on
compressed sensing. The ECG and PPG signals in the heart signal were used as research signals. Firstly,
the sparsity of ECG and PPG signals was studied, and the effects of ECG and PPG signals reconstructed
using a single sparse basis and a redundant dictionary constructed by K-SVD were compared under
the same measurement matrix and reconstruction algorithm. Obviously, the effect of the redundant
dictionary of the K-SVD structure was better. Then, the performance of the SWOMP algorithm for the
heart signal was analyzed. To address the disadvantages of the SWOMP algorithm (i.e., its lack of
stability and low precision), an improved SWAMP algorithm was proposed. The simulation proved
that the SWAMP algorithm is better than the SWOMP algorithm.
We also analyzed the application of compressed sensing in ECG and PPG signal recognition. Firstly,
the ECG and PPG signals were predicted and processed by wavelet transform, and the feature of the
reconstructed signal was extracted as the recognition basis by using the SVM. The experimental results
showed that the recognition rate before and after reconstruction was the same, which further verified
the accuracy and practicability of compressed sensing for portable remote heart signal identification.
