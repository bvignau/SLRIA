Here an effort is made to use human electrocardiogram as a tool of biometric analysis for
authentication. The proposed method is based on first accurate extraction of characteristic
features from each ECG and then design of a suitable classification methodology to com-
ment on the authenticity. As the feature matrix is a huge one, Principal Component Anal-
ysis (PCA) is applied to avoid handling of large amount of data. Next, the reduced features
from PCA are fitted into a quadratic polynomial model by the method of least square. Then
the fitted values for the allowed set of data is obtained and the range over which they vary,
provides the signature matrix of a person. Finally the classification is done by a comparison
based on nearest neighbor method. The method is tested on ECG of 20 individuals taken
from PTB database. This method has accuracy more than 95% with the best fit modeling
which becomes only 80% without data modeling proving the importance of best fit model-
ing of data before classification. This accuracy is comparable with conventional biometric
techniques; moreover, ECG biometric can be used with other authentication scheme, with
ECG providing liveliness proof.

1. Introduction
The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a record of time-varying
bioelectric potential generated by electrical activity of the
heart. It has become a fundamental tool of diagnosing dif-
ferent cardiac and blood circulation abnormalities [1]. The
interpretation of ECG leads to a decision on electrical or
functional abnormality of heart. In recent past, different
studies have been conducted for the use of ECG in biomet-
rics apart from its conventional usage. Biometric analysis
and recognition provides security and restricted access to
protected areas by identifying the persons using his/her
physiological or behavioural features. Presently human fin-
gerprint, face, iris or voice, anatomical traits and behavioral
characteristics like signature characteristics and dynamics,
etc. are the features that are being used singly or a fusion of
more than one of them in biometric recognition systems.
However, these biometrics modalities either cannot pro-
vide reliable performance in terms of recognition accuracy
(e.g., gait, keystroke) or they are prone to falsification
externally. Some examples of falsification are 3D finger-
print and face models or plastic surgery on these features,
voice playback from a different source and contact lenses
with different iris features printed on. In this regard, ECG
has a great opportunity to be used as a non-falsifiable bio-
metric parameter. As ECG is the electrical activity gener-
ated due to the auto-rhythm of pacemaker cells of
cardiac dipole, it is almost impossible to modulate the sig-
nal from the outside world.
Recently some research has made to test the applicabil-
ity of ECG as a biometric feature [2–4]. The possibility to
use ECG as a biometric feature is supported by the fact that
there is uniqueness in the individual ECG because of phys-
iological and geometrical differences of the heart of differ-
ent persons [5–7]. Biel et al. [8] have conducted the
biometric experiment on ECG recorded from a group of
20 subjects. Twelve features have been selected from each
record for identification of a person in a predefined group.
Shen et al. [9] have investigated the feasibility of ECG as a
new biometric for identity verification. The experiment has
been conducted on 20 individuals on seven features,

extracted from mainly QRS complex. Using the techniques
of neural network and template matching the experiment
of human identity verification has been performed. Irvine
et al. [10] proposed a technique based on heart rate vari-
ability and some other temporal features with only a group
of five subjects. A QRS complex based approach with its
fourth order Legendre Polynomial as the signature is also
proposed by Khalil et al. [11] with good accuracy. Wang
et al. [12] has proposed methods using fiducial points
and without fiducial points by AC/DCT technique for two
groups with 13 subjects in each. Classification is done
based on linear discrimination analysis and neural network
based technique. In AC/DCT method similarity between the
subjects is measured based on normalized Euclidian dis-
tance and a nearest neighbor is used as the classifier. But
this ECG morphology based approach may fail when
appearance of two ECGs are similar. Chan et al. [13] use a
wavelet distance measurement technique for classification
of 50 subjects with accuracy 89%. In [14] S.C. Fang et al.
have proposed a technique for person identification by
making the classification based on the similarities and dis-
similarities on electrocardiogram phase space. A PCA/LDA
based approach is also suggested by Baumbarov et al.
[15]. A non-fiducial feature based technique is reported
by J.L.C. Loong in [16] using spectral coefficients computed
through linear predictive coding (LPC) and classification is
done using neural network based approach. Double fold
approach is proposed by Safie et al. in [17] where the
parameters of the pulse active ratio (PAR) feature vector
are represented by a four digit PIN number. Authentication
is made for 20 subjects first by verifying the PIN number
and finally by ECG feature vector matching. Most of the re-
ported methods either suffers from lack of good accuracy
or requires complicated mathematical procedures for pro-
cessing and classification. Moreover, some of the previous
works use 12 lead ECG for biometric authentication which
is impractical to use in real biometric system in spite of
good result.
In this paper we investigate the applicability of ECG as a
biometric parameter with a requirement of fiducial detec-
tion for 20 subjects. Here 16 parameters including ampli-
tude, temporal and angular features are extracted. Almost
all works regarding ECG based biometric authentication,
some data reduction technique is required to handle this
large set of database. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
is a commonly used tool used for this purpose as used in
the present work also. Additionally, here it is shown that
classification accuracy greatly improves if the resulting
data after PCA is modeled by a quadratic polynomial based
curve fitting algorithm as then higher half of the reduced
feature set is better discriminated. The steps of the pro-
posed algorithm are shown in Fig. 1.
Not only for human identification, the technique of
using ECG data in biometry offers some unique advantages.
In automatic cardiac care units, it is required to monitor
the patients continuously. This technique can provide
identity of persons remotely without the requirement of
any additional data processing. Thus it is advantageous to
verify a patient’s identity in medical records or prior to
drug administration or other medical procedures from a
remotely located control room.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Signal pre-processing and feature extraction
In most of the cases recorded ECG data are corrupted by
various high and low frequency noises arising from power
line interference (for high frequency noise) and respiration,
body movement, EMG, etc. (for low frequency noise). ECG
filtering from any kind of above mentioned noise is man-
datory from biometric analysis otherwise wrong estima-
tion of features may lead to misclassification. In this
work wavelet transform based filtering and feature extrac-
tion is performed. The method is taken from [18]. Wavelet
transform is basically a convolution operation between the
mother wavelet and the test signal as the mother wavelet
translates along the test signal in time axis. Here db6 is
chosen as mother wavelet due to its structural resem-
blance with the QRS complex of the ECG signal and decom-
position is made up to level eight. Fig. 2 shows the
decomposition of a typical ECG signal with db6 wavelet.
The coefficient of level one may be considered as mostly
noise with respect to the important high frequency param-
eters of ECG when the sampling frequency of the mother
signal is 1000 Hz. According to the power spectra of the
signal [19], it is clear that most energy of the QRS complex
is concentrated at decomposition level 3, 4 and 5. The
reconstructed wave with these coefficients is enhanced
and the highest potential point is considered as R peak.
Generally the Q and S waves are high frequency and low
amplitude waves and their energies are mainly prominent
at small scale. For that decomposition coefficients from d2
to d5 are retained and a five point differentiation is made
to find out the point of inflections for Q and S points on
either side of R peak. The energies of T and P waves are
mainly at scale levels 6, 7 and 8. But, low frequency base-

line drift may appear at scale 8, so reconstruction coeffi-
cients d6 and d7 are selected to detect T and P waves. Then
the T peak is identified as the maxima after the detected S
point within a predefined interval. As the T peak is pointed
out, T onset and T offset is found out as the minimum po-
tential crossing points on either side of the T peak. Fig. 3
shows the detected QRS complex, P and T wave for a typi-
cal ECG waveform. As it is not possible to define the fea-
tures which differ from different persons in a group,
maximum possible numbers of features are extracted for
better accuracy of the analysis.
Figs. 4A–4C are the pictorial representation of the fea-
tures used for biometric authentication which is tabulated
in Table 1.
2.2. Data transformation by principal component analysis
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [20] is one of the
oldest and most widely used data transformation tech-
niques for multivariable analysis. The dimension of input
dataset is reduced using this technique. PCA is mathemat-
ically defined as an orthogonal linear transformation that
transforms the data to a new coordinate system such that
the greatest variance by any projection of the data comes
to lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal com-
ponent), the second greatest variance on the second coor-
dinate, and so on.
Let X be the N dimensional dataset of length L where
each column represents a specific parameter extracted
during multiple observation. The empirical mean of the
dataset is calculated as

The deviation from the mean is given by

where u(n) = 1 for n = 1,. . ., N. Then the covariance matrix is

where D� stands for the transpose matrix of D. Next the Ei-
gen vector matrix G is calculated which diagonalizes the
covariance matrix. Hence,

where V is the diagonal matrix of Eigen values of C. Next,
the diagonal matrix V is arranged in descending order
and a specific subset of it is selected as basis vector. A plot
of the basis vector for a typical record is shown in Fig. 5.
2.3. Data fitting
The output of the data reduction technique shows that
the reduced feature values decrease appreciably in such a
way that it becomes difficult to classify the data for
authentication especially in the upper half of the data set
which results in less accuracy for classification as indicated
in the next sections. Hence the resulting data set is statis-
tically modeled based on explicit mathematical function.
The standard form of the statistical model is denoted
by,
y ¼ fð~x;~aÞ þ k
ð5Þ
where y is the response or output, ~x stands for the collec-
tion of all the predictor variables and ~a is the collection
of all parameters in short. k is the random error.
Polynomial models are most frequently used for math-
ematical modeling. A general polynomial model is given
by,
y ¼ anxn þ an�1xn�1 þ � � � þ a2x2 þ a1x1 þ a0
ð6Þ
where n is a non-negative integer denoting the degree of
the polynomial. Besides its simplicity and flexibility, poly-
nomial model have the advantage that the mapping retains
the input structure of the data. Observation of the PCA out-
put enables to select the quadratic polynomial model as,
y ¼ a0 þ a1x þ a2x2
ð7Þ
where a0, a1, a2 are modeling coefficients. Modeling coeffi-
cients are calculated by least square fitting method by least

square estimation. Mathematically the least square criteria

In this technique the unknown values of the parameters
are so calculated that the sum of the squared deviations
between the input and the functional portion of the model
is minimized. The output after best fit is shown in Fig. 6. It
is clear from this figure that now it will be easier for any
classifier to discriminate the patterns.
3. Comparison for authentication
As per the previous steps, the ECG beat pattern for each
person is transformed into a set of six best fit values pro-
viding the biometric signature for each person. For a clas-
sifying system for authentication, it is required to accept
a predetermined set of signatures and reject the others.
Here the classification is done using a simple nearest
neighbor method. It marks a new entry as the class corre-
sponding to a stored signature that gives the minimum dis-
tance for each best fit value. Any test signature matrix
element value is considered similar to a stored data if the
test value falls within ±2% of the stored one.
4. Result and analysis
The algorithm is tested against 20 databases taken from
PTB diagnostic data from physionet data bank [21]. All
beats are normal and having 1 kHz sampling frequency.
16 features are extracted from each wave as stated earlier.

To make the result more convenient, all the features are
detected nine times from nine different waves of same re-
cord taken in some arbitrary intervals thus generating a
16 � 9 feature matrix. Then the use of PCA generates the
signature matrix with dimension 1 � 6. The resulting out-
put is shown in Fig. 6. It shows the overlapping nature of
the matrix mainly in the last three elements which makes
classification less accurate.
Quadratic polynomial based best fit modeling modifies
the signature matrix making the higher order attributes
more significant as shown in Fig. 7. From Figs. 7 and 8 it
is seen that the discrimination of the signature matrix for
same element especially in the higher order is better if
the data is modeled with the best fit algorithm as discussed
earlier. As the spread of the signature is more, it is easier to
classify using nearest neighbor method. The comparison of
each element of the test signature is made with the stored
patterns and the signature with minimum distance with
most of the elements is identified as equivalent to the test
entry. Without the best fit modeling, the accuracy was 80%
whereas it becomes 95% with best fit modeling.
5. Discussion
In this work the applicability of ECG for biometric
authentication is studied. ECG has a good potential to be
a biometric parameter as the signal source is beyond the
scope of falsification.
Moreover, it can be used as a liveliness detector along
with the biometric application. There are basically two
types of methods used for ECG based biometric analysis
– one is feature detection based and depending on overall
texture of the signal is the other. Most of the existing
works uses feature extraction followed by a classification
algorithm based on ANN or other. In this technique, nor-
mally for better accuracy of biometric signature, a number
of features are detected and each feature is measured sev-
eral times from different signals of the same person to
make it robust and reliable. Hence the resulting data for
each person is a huge one and needs to be dimensionally
reduced retaining the essence of parameters. Principal
Component Analysis is a well adopted tool for the same.
Here the classification is made by the measurement of
nearest neighbor from the stored set of data of signature
matrix by comparison with the new entry. It is seen that
the accuracy level is 80% for person identification. It is no-
ticed that the higher half of the signature matrix for most
of the persons are quite similar leading to misclassification
in some cases. Hence a novel quadratic curve fitting algo-
rithm is proposed based on least square fit of the modeled
data. This best fit data shows greater discrimination at the
lower half of the signature matrix for each person and the
accuracy level goes up to 95% for person identification. This
method is also useful for tracking the identity of the
patients remotely without any additional data processing.
Thus automatic monitoring or other medical procedures
may be done without any human intervention. Other
physiological or behavioral biometric parameters may be
fused with the ECG based technique to make the authenti-
cation more reliable.
