Abstract—In this paper, we present noise-robust photoplethys-
mographic (PPG) based biometric authentication method for
wireless body area networks and m-health applications. The
method consists of four steps: (i) preprocessing of PPG signals,
(ii) systolic peak detection, (iii) ensemble averaged pulsatile
waveform extraction and (iv) pulsatile waveform similarity
matching using a normalized cross correlation (NCC) measure.
The performance of the proposed method is tested and validated
using different types of PPG signals taken from the standard
PPG databases. For predefined threshold of 0.997, the NCC-
based PPG biometric method achieves an average false rejection
rate (FRR) of 0.32 and false acceptance rate (FAR) of 0.32.
Performance evaluation results show that the proposed method
achieves consistent authentication results as compared to the
other methods under different kinds of artifacts and noise.
I. INTRODUCTION
Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a simple non-invasive and
low-cost optical technique that can be used to detect blood
volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. The
PPG signal has been used in a wide range of commercially
available medical devices for measuring oxygen saturation,
blood pressure and cardiac output, assessing autonomic func-
tion and also detecting peripheral vascular disease. In recent
years, PPG signal is an emerging biometric identifier for
human authentication because of the following advantages:
universality, uniqueness, robustness to spoofing attacks, in-
trinsic aliveness detection, adaptive authentication by updating
enrolled template with new physiological feature that evolves
with time, ease of physiological recording, ease of feature
extraction by exploiting the structural patterns of the phys-
iological signal, low-cost signal acquisition, and continuous
availability of physiological signals on wearable body area
networks (WBAN), home healthcare and m-health monitoring
applications [1]-[5]. The feasibility of beat-by-beat patterns
and morphological features of PPG signals for biometric
authentication is well studied in the previously published
works [6]-[8]. Fig. 1 demonstrates the inter-beat correlation
between PPG beat patterns of PPG signals for two different
subjects. It can be observed that there is a highly significant
correlation among the pulsatile cycles of the PPG signal.

Illustrates beat-to-beat correlation of PPG signals taken from two

Therefore, the inter-pulsatile waveform correlation is exploited
in most physiological signal based unimodal and multimodal
biometric systems. In the next subsection, we briefly describe
the signal processing and pattern recognition techniques used
in the existing PPG-based biometric methods.
A. Existing PPG Biometric Methods
Many PPG-based biometric methods have been developed
based on the digital filters, beat correlation [6], Fourier anal-
ysis and semi discrete decomposition, and Euclidean distance
[7], linear discriminant analysis, nearest neighbor classification
[8], local maxima/minma and inflection points and time inter-
vals [9], Hamming distance measure [10], fiducial features and
discriminant function [11], fuzzy-based decision-making [12],
kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and Mahalanobis
distance measure [13], multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), time
domain features and k-NN based classification [15].
Many PPG-based biometric methods have been developed
based on the pulsatile waveform patterns and/or the local
features of the pulsatile waveforms of the PPG signal and the
similarity matching or classifiers [6]-[15]. In [6], Bonissi et al.
presented PPG biometrics based on the third order high pass
Butterworth filtering for baseline normalization, peak detection
using a modified Pan-Tompkins algorithm, heartbeat averaging
and template matching. The method achieves minimum EER
of 9%. In [7], Salanke et al. presented human identification
based on the noise removal using Fourier series analysis,
978-1-5090-2361-5/16/$31.00 c⃝ 2016 IEEE
feature extraction and selection using semi discrete decompo-
sition and Euclidean distance. Spachos et al. proposed a PPG
biometric identification based on the peak detection, PPG cycle
segmentation, normalization, time domain scaling, linear dis-
criminant analysis, nearest neighbor classification. The method
achieves an EER of 25% for the test signals of 29 subjects
[8]. In [9], Yao et al. proposed PPG-based biometric method
including the following steps: noise removal using Chebyshev
low pass filter, polynomial curve fitting, finding numbers of
maxima/minima points and inflection points, and their time
intervals from first and second derivatives and correlation. In
[11], PPG biometric method based on discriminant function
with four feature parameters extracted from PPG signals
including, the number of peaks on each pulse, the upward
slope of pulse, the downward slope, the time interval between
foot and the first peak point. The method achieves a correct
verification rate of up to 94%. In [12], Gu and Zhang proposed
a PPG authentication using fuzzy-based decision-making with
four distinctive features. In [13], Salanke et al. proposed
an intrinsic PPG biometric method for identifying individual
that based on the peak detection and segmentation, feature
extraction using kernel principal component analysis (KPCA)
and Mahalanobis distance measure. In [14], pattern recognition
based on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) which are employed
to learn patterns in time segments around onset and peak points
on PPG signal. The method achieves a classification accuracy
98.1%. Kavsaoglu et al. presented PPG biometric recognition
based on the following stages: pre-processing using FIR filters,
time domain features extraction from differentiation stage,
distance based feature ranking stage, k-NN based classification
[15]. The method achieves 94.44% identification accuracy.
Based on the feature extraction process, the existing
PPG based biometric authentication methods can be grouped
into four major categories: direct waveform-based methods,
pulsatile waveform correlation-based methods, FP (fiducial
points)-based methods, and hybrid methods combining the pul-
satile waveform correlation and local features of the pulsatile
waveform. The pulsatile waveform and fiducial points based
methods generally include the steps of: noise removal, peak
detection and pulsatile waveform segmentation, feature extrac-
tion, and classification using similarity measure or machine
learning classifiers. The false rejection rate (FRR) and false ac-
ceptance rate (FAR) of most pulsatile waveform-based and FP-
based PPG biometric authentication methods highly depends
on accurate extraction of pulsatile waveforms (or pulsatile
cycles) and reliable measurement of morphological features
of the PPG beats under different kinds of artifacts and noise.
The presence of motion artifacts in PPG signals is one of the
major obstacles in the accurate and reliable measurement of
pulsatile waveform features (including, SPamp, Famp, DPamp,
DNamp, pulse width (PW), peak-peak interval (PPint), pulse
interval, pulse area, inflection point area ratio (IPA), crest time
(CT), reflection index (RI), and augmentation index) under
varying morphological patterns of pulsatile waveforms and
noise conditions. However, a very little attention is paid in
developing robust, low-complexity and automatic PPG-based
biometric authentication method that has great potential in
body area sensor networks and mobile healthcare systems.
In this paper, we attempt to develop a noise-robust pul-
satile waveform recognition method in improving accuracy
of biometric authentication system under time-varying shapes
of the pulsatile waveforms and various kinds of noise. The
proposed PPG biometric method consists of four major stages:
preprocessing, systolic peak detection, ensemble averaged
pulsatile waveform extraction, and similarity matching using
a normalized cross correlation metric. The rest of the paper is
organized as follows. In Section II, we present the proposed
PPG-based biometric method. In Section III, we evaluate the
performance of the proposed method using clean and noisy
PPG signals. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section IV.
II. PROPOSED PPG BASED BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION
In this paper, we present noise-robust PPG biometric method
using pulsatile waveform correlation. The method consists of
four steps: (i) preprocessing of PPG signals, (ii) detection of
systolic peaks in the processed PPG signal, (iii) ensemble av-
eraged pulsatile waveform extraction and similarity matching
using normalized cross correlation (NCC) measure.
A. Preprocessing
The PPG signals are often corrupted by various noises
including baseline wanders, power-line interference and in-
strumentation noises. To suppress noises and artifacts, many
noise filtering techniques including derivatives, digital filters,
wavelet transform, empirical mode decomposition, adaptive
filters and filter banks were used at the processing stage. The
signal decomposition approach showed better noise reduction
performance compared to the time-domain and frequency
domain filtering approaches but at the expense of higher
computational load. In this work, we design a preprocessing
step that uses a Gaussian derivative filter (GDF) to remove
baseline wanders and eliminates high-frequency noises. The
length and spread of the Gaussian derivative kernel is deter-
mined empirically in such that it can simultaneously preserve
the shapes of pulsatile waveforms and suppress the baseline
wanders and high-frequency noises. The M × 1 coefficients
vector of a Gaussian kernel g[m] are computed as
g[m] = e− 1
2
(m− M
2 )2
σ2
m = 1, 2, 3, ........, M
(1)
where M denotes the length of Gaussian kernel and σ denotes
the width spread (or standard deviation) of the Gaussian
kernel. The width of the Gaussian kernel is directly related
to the value of σ. A larger value of σ produces a more larger
pulse width. Then, Gaussian derivative kernel is computed as
h[m] = g[m + 1] − g[m]
m = 1, 2, 3, ......., M − 1
(2)
The Gaussian kernel with pulse width of 100 ms and spread
σ of 80 ms is used for noise suppression. The filtered signal
f[n] is obtained by taking the convolution of a signal x[n]
and Gaussian derivative kernel h[n]. The output of the filtering
step is shown in Fig. 2(b) for the noisy PPG signal as shown

in Fig.2(a). The results show that the GDF based filtering
approach adequately suppresses the background noises and
emphasizes the systolic portions.
B. Systolic Peak Detection
The systolic peak detection stage consists of three major
steps: nonlinear peak amplification, Gaussian derivative based
peak finding scheme, and peak position adjustment procedure.
1) Squaring and Adaptive thresholding: The filtered signal
f[n] is first squared to obtain a positive-valued signal and then
adaptive thresholding is performed on the energy signal e[n]
that is computed as
e[n] = f 2[n].
(3)
The squaring operation further suppresses the amplitudes
of the low-frequency artifacts meanwhile it emphasizes the
amplitude of the components of the systolic peaks. In order to
remove the low-amplitudes of residual noise components the
adaptive thresholding rule is implemented as
eth[n] =
�
0,
e[n] < η
e[n],
e[n] > η
(4)
where the threshold η is computed for each block. The
adaptive threshold η for each PPG segment is computed as

where N is the number of samples.
2) Shannon Energy Envelope (SEE) Signal Extraction:
Although the squaring operation suppresses the residual noise
components, it also diminishes amplitude of low-amplitude
pulsatile waveforms that may be buried in the high-amplitude
pulsatile waveforms. Therefore, we employ Shannon energy
operation that can significantly reduce the peak-amplitude
deviations between smaller systolic peaks and high-amplitude
peaks. The Shannon energy of the normalized signal is com-
puted as
s[n] = −˜e2
th[n] log ˜e2
th[n].

The multiple peaks in the Shannon energy envelope (SEE)
signal may increase number of false positive detections. There-
fore, the envelope smoothing process is implemented using a
linear zero-phase filtering with a rectangular impulse response,
h(k) of length L. The smoothing filter is designed to provide
smoothed peaked-waves around systolic peak portions and to
smooth out the multiple peaks. The smoothness depends on
the filter length L, which is found empirically. In this work,
window length of 150 ms is chosen that is less than refractory
period of 300 ms. The output of the SEE extraction step is
shown in Fig. 2(c). It can be observed that the time-instants
of candidate systolic peaks in the smooth SEE signal s[n]
correspond to approximate time-instants of the systolic peaks
in the PPG signal. Therefore, the candidate peaks are first
detected and then used as guides to determine time-instants of
true systolic peaks in the input PPG signal.
3) Peak Location Determination and Correction Rule: In
this step, the time-instants of candidate systolic peaks are
automatically determined by processing the negative zero-
crossing points of the output waveform obtained from the
convolution of the Shannon energy envelope signal s[n] with
Gaussian derivative kernel d[n] with width (M) of 2 s and
spread of σ = 240 ms. The convolution between these two
signals is computed as
z[n] =
∞
�
k=−∞
d[k] s[n − k].
(7)
The output of the convolution stage is shown in Fig. 2(d) for
the envelope signal as shown in Fig. 2(c). It is observed from
the Fig. 2(d) that the negative zerocrossing points correspond
to the locations of the local peaks of the Shannon energy
envelope s[n] shown in Fig. 2(c). Therefore, the negative
zero-crossing points are detected and used as guides to find
locations of true systolic peaks in the original PPG signal
shown in Fig. 2(a). The output of the negative zerocrossing
point determination step is shown in Fig. 2(d). The peak
location adjustment procedure is employed to correct the errors
of peak position shift due to the signal smoothing steps. In
the correction procedure, a PPG segment centered around a
detected location (p[m]± w
2 ) is extracted from the PPG signal
and then location of maximum amplitude of the extracted
PPG segment is computed to locate true systolic peaks in
PPG signal. The window size (w) is set to 120 ms. The peak
correction procedure is repeated for all the detected candidate
locations p[m]. The final detected systolic peaks are marked
in the PPG signal as shown in Fig. 2(e). The peak detection
results shown in Figs. 2 and 3 demonstrate the effectiveness
of the systolic peak detection approach under different types
of pulsatile waveform morphologies and noise conditions.

C. Ensemble Averaged Pulsatile Waveform Extraction
In this work, we obtain a PPG biometric identifier based
on ensemble averaging of time-instant aligned segmented
pulsatile waveforms of the PPG signal of an individual. In
the enrollment phase, the pulsatile waveforms obtained for 20
s PPG signal are used to construct one ensemble averaged
pulsatile waveform for each of the individuals in the enroll-
ment phase. For P sets of pulsatile waveforms from the PPG
signal of an each individual, the ensemble averaging process
is implemented as

and eh denotes the ensemble pulsatile waveforms. Under
the presence of the recording instrument noise (or random
noise), the ensemble averaging can reduce the residual noise
components in the pulsatile signal. The ensemble pulsatile
waveforms obtained for all of individuals are stored in the
enrollment database. The ensemble averaged pulsatile wave-
form extraction stage includes the steps of: pulsatile wave-
form segmentation, period and amplitude normalization, S-
peak alignment and ensemble averaged pulsatile waveform
computation. The algorithm for the extraction of ensemble
averaged pulsatile waveform is illustrated in Table I.

The outputs of the ensemble averaged pulsatile waveform
extraction algorithm are illustrated in Figs. 4-5 for PPG
signals with different pulsatile morphologies. From the results
as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b) and Fig. 5(a) and (b), we
can observe that the local features of the original pulsatile
waveforms are not preserved in the constructed ensemble
averaged pulsatile waveform without using the Systolic peak
(S-peak) alignment process. The extracted ensemble averaged
pulsatile waveforms using the S-peak alignment process are
shown in Fig. 4(d) and Fig. 5(d). It can be observed that
the morphological features of the original pulsatile waveforms
are significantly preserved in the extracted ensemble averaged
pulsatile waveform.
D. Similarity Metrics For Template Matching
In this subsection, we study the effectiveness of the dif-
ferent similarity metrics (including, normalized cross corre-
lation (NCC) [17], [18], [19], wavelet weighted-based PRD
(WWPRD) [18] and wavelet distance measure (WDIST) [19],
[20]) that are used in the existing biometric authentication
methods. For the test pulsatile waveform template xt, and
the enrolled pulsatile waveform template xei for subject
i(i = 1, 2, ..., M; M is the number of subject enrolled in the
biometric database), the NCC is computed as [17], [18], [19]

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We study the performance of the PPG-based biometric
methods that have been developed using the proposed ensem-
ble averaged pulsatile waveform extraction approach and three
similarity measures such as NCC [19], [18], [17], WDIST
[19], [20] and WWPRD [18]. In this work, the PPG signals
are collected from the standard pulse signal databases: MIT-
BIH Polysomnographic Database (slpdb) and Challenge 2014
Training Set (Challenge/2014/set-p). The pulse signals are
sampled at rate of 250 Hz. The three PPG biometric methods
are tested and validated using 24 genuine and 6 imposter
subjects with total of 30 subjects. In the training phase, the
ensemble averaged pulsatile waveform is constructed from
pulse signal duration of 20 s for each of the subjects. The
total number of enrolled subjects is 24. In the testing phase, we
created 567 test segments for each of the genuine and imposter
subjects. Each segment duration is 10 s. The total numbers
of test segments for the genuine and imposter subjects are
13608 and 3402, respectively. In this study, the authentication
is performed based on the pulsatile beat-by-beat correlation
analysis of 10 s pulse signal from each subject. The rejection
or acceptance of subject is performed based on the maximum
similarity score which is greater than the half of the total
number of beats of the 10 s pulse signal. The similarity score
is computed based on the binary matching scores obtained for
the optimal correlation threshold.
For validation purposes, we compute the three benchmark
parameters [5]: false acceptance rate (FAR), false rejection rate
(FRR) and equal error rate (EER) that are defined as
FAR = FA
NI
and
FRR = FR
NG
(14)
where FA denotes number of false acceptances by the system,
NI denotes the number of impostors, FR denotes number of
false rejections and NG denotes number of genuine subjects.
The equal error rate (EER) is defined as the rate at which the
false acceptance rate equals the false rejection rate [5]. The
value of the EER can be easily obtained from the receiver
operating characteristics (ROC) curve that ranges between 0
and 1. The ROC curves for three authentication methods are
shown in Fig. 6. From the ROC curve of each of the biometric
methods, the optimal threshold is found for further testing and
validation of the three biometric methods under different noise
conditions and noise levels.
From the results as shown in Fig. 6, the optimal threshold
for the NCC-based method is 0.997 whereas the optimal
thresholds for the WWPRD- and WDIST-based methods are
12.8 and 6.3, respectively. The EER values are 0.29, 0.325,
and 0.45, respectively. For the optimal thresholds, we study
the robustness of the three biometric methods under different
SNR values and noise types. The experimental results of this
study are summarized in Table II. The authentication results
show that the PPG biometric method using the NCC metric
yields better performance with FAR of 0.24 and FRR of
0.41 for SNR value of 20 dB. Moreover, the NCC based
method demonstrates the better authentication results for clean

and noisy PPG signals. From the authentication results, it is
observed that the Gaussian derivative based filtering approach
can provide better detection rates in case of PPG signals
with baseline wanders and powerline interference. Unlike
the existing methods using DWT, EMD and PCA/ICA, and
adaptive filters, the proposed systolic peak detection approach
uses simple filtering technique. From our experimental results,
it is noted that the proposed approach yields detection accuracy
of 99.5-100% for most PPG signals including different pulse
morphologies, baseline wanders, and powerline interference.
The PPG biometric method using ensemble averaged pulsatile
waveform and NCC metric achieves a FAR of 0.32 and FRR
of 0.32 for the threshold of 0.997. The proposed method
outperforms the other wavelet distance based methods. By
comparing the complexity of the functional blocks of existing
methods, we believe that the PPG biometric method based
on the pulsatile waveform correlation is simple compared to
the local features and machine learning based PCG biometric
methods. In the future directions, we study effectiveness of
the PPG biometric under different physical activities.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we present PPG biometric method using
pulsatile waveform correlation. The proposed method consists
of four stages: preprocessing, systolic peak detection, en-
semble averaged pulsatile waveform extraction, and similarity
matching. The proposed method is tested and validated using
the PPG signals taken from 24 genuine and 6 imposter
subjects. Performance evaluation results show that the PPG
biometric method using NCC metric achieves a FAR of 0.32
and FRR of 0.32 for the threshold of 0.997 that outperforms
the other wavelet distance based methods which have higher
computational load. Results show that the proposed method
has great potential in wireless body area networks and m-
health applications.
