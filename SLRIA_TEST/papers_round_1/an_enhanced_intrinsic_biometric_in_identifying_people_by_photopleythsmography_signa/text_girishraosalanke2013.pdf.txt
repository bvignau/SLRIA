Abstract In the area of secure authentication, the fusion of Photopleythsmography
(PPG) signals for biometric identification is a novel technique. Researchers sug-
gested the use of PPG along with other biometric components for augmenting the
biometric robustness. PPG signals have great potential to serve as biometric
identification appliance and can be easily obtained with low cost. Use of PPG
signals for personnel identification is very appropriate during field operations in day
or night. While building a large scale identification system the feature selection
from PPG is a critical activity. To have the identification system more accurate, the
set of features that deemed to be the most effective attributes are extracted in order
to build robust identification system. Applying Kernel Principal Component anal-
ysis (KPCA) an efficient supervised learning method for dimensionality reduction
and feature extraction in this experiment results in precise classification.

1 Introduction
In search of robust biometrics that is not compromised, researchers started to try
with unseen internal organs rather than conventional outer organs with all their
varying dimension and activity. They seems to be more reliable types of bio-
metrics in human authentication and identification systems than the simple ones
used in applications like personnel security, hospital, finance, digital rights etc.
conventional biometric system [1] using behavioral and physiological character-
istics to allow recognition of an individual, like face recognition [2], fingerprint
[3], iris and retinal patterns [4] and voice [5] are becoming very popular. The
common weakness of conventional biometric system is their vulnerability and the
possibility to falsity of their features. In 1977, Forsen listed the possible features of
a human body that could be used for biometrics were ECG [6] and EEG [7]. The
basic approach is to extract the signals from the user during the enrollment phase,
the extracted signals from the user then attempts to log in, the particulars are
computed, which determines the decision outcome. This is really no different than
any other behavioral biometric, the novelty here is the data that are acquired. In
order to acquire biological signal data, specialized hardware is required. Especially
the EEG and ECG acquisition hardware is complex and tedious processes is
involved. In this paper, we examine the use of Photoplethysmograph (PPG) sig-
nals, which is acquired using a very simple hardware interface for human iden-
tification [8]. PPG has distinct advantages including low development cost, easy to
use without any complicated procedure and conveniently accessible to various
sites of human body, such as finger, wrist or arm. Moreover, PPG signals provide a
noninvasive and accurate methodology to obtain valuable physiological informa-
tion such as blood oxygen saturation, heart rate and blood flow.
The blood in human body is being pumped from the heart to all parts in the
body by blood vessels called arteries. Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing
against the walls of the arteries. Each time the heart beats it pumps out a con-
siderable volume of blood to the arteries. Systolic pressure which is the highest
blood pressure occurs when heart is in pumping motion. Diastolic pressure is
lowest blood pressure when heart is in resting [9]. Since blood pressure are an
indirect measurement of heart beats and the blood pressure tend to change
according to time and emotion. For instance, blood pressure will rise when a
subject is awaken and excited. The unit for measurement of blood pressure is in
mmHg and the notation will be systolic followed by diastolic pressure.
The Photoplethysmograph (PPG) signals reflect the change in blood volume
caused by blood vessel expansion and contraction, which can be detected by
photodiode if external light is illuminated into tissue. This method is based on the
idea that if an externally applied pressure in the cuff is equal to the arterial pressure
instantaneously, the arterial walls will be unloaded (zero transmural pressure) and
the arteries will not change in size. In this condition, the blood volume will not
change.

Digital Photoplethysmographic sensor used to read a PPG signal has an infrared
emitter and photodiode detector. The intensity of light from infrared emitter which
reaches the photodiode detector in either reflection or transmission will be mea-
sured to determine the blood volume changes. The Photoplethysmographic sensor
will be placed below the tip of the finger and pressure will be applied on the
proximal phalanx. Since the cuff is wrapped on the proximal phalanx of the finger
rather than arm, it makes less discomfort for prolonged used. The blood volume
changes on the finger will be notified by the sensor and transmitted to the system
by wired or bluetooth transmitter. There will be a timer attached on the device to
time the cuff pressure applied time and transmitter so that it is semi-continuous
measurement. This is because to decrease the energy consumption of Bluetooth
transmission and to avoid discomfort of the wearer’s finger due to continuous
pressure applied.
The idea of the blood pressure sensor is much like the Photoplethysmograph
Fingernail Sensor for measurement offinger force which is mentioned by Stephen A.
Mascaro and H. Harry Asada [10]. The finger force is measuring colouration of
fingernail by using reflectance Photoplethysmography. The Fig. 1 shows the
fingernail sensor used in this research.
2 Related Work
A brief survey of the related work in the area of identification using PPG signals is
presented in this section. Earlier work by Y. Y Gu et al. [11, 12] on biometrics
with PPG signals used to represent the pulse using four quantities; the peak
number, the upward slope, the downward slope and the time interval from the
bottom to peak. Jianchu Yao et al. [13] examines two important issues in applying
derivatives of PPG signals as discriminants to identify and verify subjects.
Andrews Samraj et al. [8] demonstrated the intra trial variability factor which
enhanced the signature verification system that uses PPG Signal as one of its
combination. Singular value decomposition (SVD) was used as a dimension
reduction tool. In this paper, we propose a technique for human identification by
applying kernel principal component analysis for dimension reduction.

3 Methodology
The methodology of this experiment is carried out in four stages as follows
(i) Experimental Setup
(ii) Preprocessing
(iii) Feature Extraction
(iv) Classification
3.1 Experimental Setup
The PPG signals were recorded using a Pulse Oximetry module (from Dolphin
Medical, Inc) that was connected to a computer using a data acquisition software
and captured with a sampling frequency of 37 Hz [14]. The main purpose of
sampling the signal at this particular frequency is to highlight that even at this
lowest frequency we were able to capture the signal. Sampling at a higher fre-
quency is very fine and accurate and may be considered later on further progress.
Four led’s of Plethysmogram were fixed on each subject while recording the data.
A total of 9 healthy subjects participated in this study. All the 9 subjects selected
were our co- scholars at VIT University and the average age of the subjects is 34.
Two PPG recordings (relaxed and stressed) were obtained from each individual
with duration of 60 s. Total of 8 signals were recorded for each subject, 4 in
relaxed sate and remaining 4 in the stressed state. Before recorded the stressed
PPG signal the subjects were made to go up and down the staircase for a couple of
times in order to increase their level of stress. There was about 30 min gap
between the time of recording the relaxed and the stressed PPG signal. Figures 2, 3
shows PPG signal recorded during the relaxed and the stressed state. The aim for
recording the relaxed and the stressed state signal is to detect whether there is
significant fluctuation in the PPG signal features of a person in both the states. The
relaxed PPG signals of all subjects shows identical waveforms but stressed PPG
signals shows unidentical waveforms due to motion artifact. The same signal was
used for training and the testing purpose. Both the recordings were taken sepa-
rately, once when the subject was very much relaxed and the other time when he
was stressed.
3.2 Preprocessing
The Preprocessing of the PPG signal consists of Peak detection, Segmentation and
finally Scaling. In peak detection, we find the maximum peak of the recorded PPG

signal. A point is considered a maximum peak if it has the local maximal value and
is preceded by another peak with their amplitude difference larger than a preset
threshold. In Segmentation we define one PPG cycle with the help of the maxi-
mum and minimum points obtained through peak detection. In Scaling since one
PPG cycle is nothing but a heart rate, and generally heart rate can potentially
increase intra-subject variability, the time duration is scaled to 100 samples.
3.3 Feature Extraction
Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) is used as dimension reduction
technique which is used for feature extraction. Kernel PCA is the reformulation of
traditional linear PCA in a high-dimensional space that is constructed using a
kernel function. In recent years, the reformulation of linear techniques using the
‘kernel trick’ has led to the proposal of successful techniques such as kernel ridge
regression and Support Vector Machines. Kernel PCA computes the principal
eigenvectors of the kernel matrix, rather than those of the covariance matrix. The

reformulation of PCA in kernel space is straightforward, since a kernel matrix is
similar to the in product of the data points in the high-dimensional space that is
constructed using the kernel function. The application of PCA in the kernel space
provides Kernel PCA the property of constructing nonlinear mappings. Kernel
PCA computes the kernel matrix K of the datapoints xi. The entries in the kernel
matrix are defined by
kij ¼ j xi;xj
�

ð1Þ
where j is a kernel function, which may be any function that gives rise to a
positive-semi definite kernel K. Subsequently, the kernel matrix K is double-
centered using the following modification of the entries

The centering operation corresponds to subtracting the mean of the features in
traditional PCA. It subtracts the mean of the data in the feature space defined by
the kernel function j. As a result, the data in the features space defined by the
kernel function will have zero-mean. Subsequently, the principal eigenvectors vi,
of the centered kernel matrix are computed. The eigenvectors of the covariance
matrix ai (in the feature space constructed by j) can now be computed, since they
are related to the eigenvectors of the kernel matrix vi and eigenvalue ki through
ai ¼

In order to obtain the low-dimensional data representation, the data is projected
onto the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix ai. The result of the projection (i.e.,
the low-dimensional data representation Y) is given by

where ai

that was also used in the computation of the kernel matrix.
3.4 Classification
Mahalanobis distance based classifier is used to identify the individuals. The use of
the Mahalanobis metric removes several of the limitations of the Euclidean metric
like automatically accounts for the scaling of the coordinate axes, corrects for
correlation between the different features and provides curved as well as linear
decision boundaries. The value of r in the given below equation

ð5Þ
is called the Mahalanobis distance from the feature vector x to the mean vector
mx, where Cx is the covariance matrix for x. It can be shown that the surfaces on
which r is constant are ellipsoids that are centered about the mean mx. In the
special case where the features are uncorrelated and the variances in all directions
are the same, these surfaces are spheres, and the Mahalanobis distance becomes
equivalent to the Euclidean distance.
We first generate a matching score by the selected feature compared with the
stored template. For each PPG Cycle, the mahalabonis distance is calculated and is
compared with the set of samples stored in the system is computed. The template
resulting in the smallest distance is considered to be the match.
4 Results and Discussion
The difference in the Mahalanobis distance between the relaxed and the stressed
state (Intra Subject Variation) for each subject is calculated. We observe that the
mahalanobis distance of the relaxed state is less when compared to the stressed
state. The table given below shows the distance for each subject for the maximum
value obtained out of 30 samples extracted during the relaxed and the stressed state
(Table 1).
We observed that the Intra Variation of all the subjects is very less and the
average Inter Variation is 20.52. Figure 4 shows the Intra Subject Variation in
Mahalanobis distance for one particular subject across 10 different samples. The
Inter subject variation (calculated from the average values between the relaxed and
the stressed state), the difference between the mahalanobis distance across different
subjects is shown in Figs. 5, 6 reveals the wide gap between the Intra trial vari-
ability, this factor can be used as a novel method of identifying people using
Photoplethysmographic signal.

5 Conclusion
We have presented a novel approach in this paper with the possibility of using
Photoplethysmographic signal in the human identification. We observe that the
stressed PPG signal from all the subjects shows distinct waveform when compared
to their relaxed state that results in the difference in the mahalonobis distance,
which can be used for the verification purpose. The most salient feature in using
the Photoplethysmographic signal as a biometric is that it cannot be easily copied
or simulated, as compared to other biometrics such as fingerprint, face or even
voice.
