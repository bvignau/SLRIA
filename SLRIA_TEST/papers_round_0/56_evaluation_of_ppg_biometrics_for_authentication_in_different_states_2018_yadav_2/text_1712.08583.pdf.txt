Abstract
Amongst all medical biometric traits, Photoplethysmo-
graph (PPG) is the easiest to acquire. PPG records the
blood volume change with just combination of Light Emit-
ting Diode and Photodiode from any part of the body. With
IoT and smart homes’ penetration, PPG recording can eas-
ily be integrated with other vital wearable devices. PPG
represents peculiarity of hemodynamics and cardiovascu-
lar system for each individual. This paper presents non-
fiducial method for PPG based biometric authentication.
Being a physiological signal, PPG signal alters with physi-
cal/mental stress and time. For robustness, these variations
cannot be ignored. While, most of the previous works fo-
cused only on single session, this paper demonstrates exten-
sive performance evaluation of PPG biometrics against sin-
gle session data, different emotions, physical exercise and
time-lapse using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and
Direct Linear Discriminant Analysis (DLDA). When evalu-
ated on different states and datasets, equal error rate (EER)
of 0.5%-6% was achieved for 45-60s average training time.
Our CWT/DLDA based technique outperformed all other
dimensionality reduction techniques and previous work.
1. Introduction
Risk of impersonation and violation in security of any
system is ever lasting threat. This risk can cause finan-
cial ruins and, is also life threatening in today’s Internet of
Things (IoT) and Smart Home Era. Hence, need of low
cost and non-invasive authentication system has never been
greater.
This is why in last two decades, biometrics re-
search has emerged as very important area of research. Pho-
toplethysmograph (PPG) is a non-invasive electro-optical
method which measures the volume of the blood flowing
through the body part under testing. It reflects the pulsative
actions of the arteries through the interaction of the oxyge-
nized hemoglobin and photons. It is believed that every per-
son has unique hemodynamics and cardiovascular system.
Since, PPG captures this unique characteristics, this paper

presents method to leverage it for biometric authentication.
PPG being a biological signal, it is harder to steal or repli-
cate. It has advantages of inherent anti-spoofing and live-
ness detection over traditional biometrics modalities. Also,
as shown in Fig.1, PPG can be recorded with just combi-
nation of LED and Photo-Diode (PD) from any part of the
body, which provides greater flexibility for systems design.
Since, PPG recording only requires LED and PD, it is very
cost effective compared to other biometric traits. In context
of medical biometrics, PPG recording doesn’t require any
kind of gel (EEG), external stimulus (TEOAE) or multiple
electrodes (ECG) and can be conveniently recorded from
virtually any part of body. All such factors give PPG bio-
metrics extra edge on other medical biometrics traits.
Apart from authentication, PPG can be used for many
clinical applications such as measuring oxygen saturation,
blood pressure, detecting peripheral vascular diseases etc.
Wearable device companies such as FitbitTM are already us-
ing PPG signals for Heart Rate(HR) measurements. PPG
based biometric system can be integrated into such devices
and smart homes’ IoT. Thus, PPG has inherent advantage of
being portable and can give user unobtrusive experience.
In practice, PPG signal is generally impaired by many
common noise sources during acquisition such as motion
artifacts, sensor movements, respiration, premature ventric-
ular contraction (PVC) and ambient light. In addition, since
PPG embodies proper functioning of heart, under physi-

cal and emotional stress, it changes along with Heart Rate
(HR). Empirical comparison of PPG signal under rest con-
dition and exercise shows considerable change in shape of
PPG signal and its spectrum. Although indiscernible, it is
also important to assess system performance under different
emotions as they influence functioning of autonomic ner-
vous system and heart. Furthermore, like any other biomet-
ric traits, it is crucial to take into account long-term behavior
with time-lapse. In this paper, system performance is eval-
uated against all such variations using 3 different datasets.
For PPG based authentication, many fiducial and non-
fiducial based approaches have been proposed in past. Fidu-
cial based methods rely on detecting fiducial points of PPG
signals shown in Fig.2 such as systolic peak, diastolic peak,
dicrotic notch, inter-pulse interval, amplitudes of peaks, etc.
Given variability in PPG shape in different states, fiducial
detection on raw PPG signal might be unsuccessful or incor-
rect. Therefore, many researchers extended the idea to first
derivative (FD) and second derivatives (SD) of raw PPG sig-
nals and used similar points on FD and SD as features for
authentication. For example, Kavsaoglu et.al. extracted 40
features from raw PPG, its FD and SD with kNN showed
94.44% accuracy [6]. On non-fiducial side, Spachos et.al.
showed feasibility of PPG as biometrics identifier reporting
0.5% and 25% EER on two different datasets using tempo-
ral features and LDA [10]. In most recent study, Karimian
et.al. showed non-fiducial approach with DWT and kNN,
reported 1.31% mean EER for 42 subjects [4]. Sarkar et.al.
evaluated variations with emotions using DEAP dataset by
approximating PPG beat with sum of gaussians and showed
accuracy of 90.53% for cross-emotions evaluation [9].
Many of the previous methods have been focused on
fiducial approach.
But fiducial points detection in every
condition is error-prone.
Therefore, in this paper non-
fiducial approach is adopted. Also, most of the prior work
has been focused on single session evaluation. For robust-
ness, it is important to check variability in different states.
We present Continous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Di-
rect Linear Discriminant Analysis (DLDA) based method
for authentication. CWT reveals unique time-frequency be-
haviour of each individual while DLDA selects CWT coef-
ficients that give maximum class separabillity. Such feature
selection is necessary for better results against variations.
Additionally, taking more pragmatic approach and training
of model was limited to 45 − 60 seconds of signal and sys-
tem performance was evaluated for different length of au-
thentication time.
Section 2 and 3 present methodology and detailed de-
scription of system comprising pre-processing, template
creation and template matching. Section 4 presents exper-
imental results in different emotional states, exercise, rest
condition and under time lapse. Section 5 concludes the
paper with observations and future work.

2. PPG Authentication System and
Methodology
System flow is similar to many biometrics authentica-
tion system. As shown in Fig.3 system consists of the three
main blocks; pre-processing, template creation and tem-
plate matching.
2.1. Pre-processing
• Filtering: Butterworth IIR Band pass filter of cutoff fre-
quencies 0.5-5 Hz and order 38 has been applied on whole
signal for the removal of the power line interference, mo-
tion artifacts, baseline wanders. After filtering amplitude
was normalized to have dynamic range of one.
• Peak Detection: Successful application of pattern recog-
nition techniques depends on reliable peak detection. Un-
like ECG, there is no standard proven algorithm for sys-
tolic peak detection in PPG. In practice, most of the lo-
cal maxima finding algorithms work reasonably well with
PPG. To find peak locations, signal is first squared to em-
phasize amplitude difference between local maxima and
other points. Thereafter, peaks were detected based on
amplitude prominence.
• False Peak Removal: Many times motion artifacts, res-
piration, ambient light falls into passband of filter. In such
cases, filtering doesn’t help. Also, filtering degrades the
amplitude of PPG peaks and causes false peak detections.
To tackle this issue, simple false peak removal technique
based on distance was employed. For any healthy subject
based on his/her age and physical activity state if heart
rate (HR) found using distance between two peaks was
outside of normal range of HR, then those peaks were re-
moved.
• Segmentation: For the features extraction, signal is seg-
mented around detected peaks. Length of each segments
is set using median HR found from signal. For given peak
location i, segment can be represented as follows:
S(j, 1.....2r + 1) = SIG(i − 2r....i + 2r)
(1)
where r is median HR calculated from signal, j is peak
number, SIG is signal and S is segment. Since, each pulse
segment covers, 3.5 to 4 pulses, it is larger in length and
gives better frequency resolution with CWT. Hence, this
choice of length was found to be producing good results.
Furthermore, each two consecutive segments in S were
averaged. This was necessary to improve SNR, damping
any unwanted random noise as segment size was larger.
2.2. Template Creation
• Features Extraction: CWT has been selected for the fea-
tures extraction. Unlike discrete wavelet transform, CWT
gives finer resolution without skipping samples. CWT re-
veals unique details of time-frequency variations in a sin-
gle person. In time domain, Wavelet transform of signal
is given by
WTx(a, b) =
1
√a
∞
�
−∞
x(t). ψ∗
�t − b
a
�
dt
(2)
In our case, x(t) is a PPG segment.
ψ(t) is mother
wavelet which is basically bandpass filter that changes
with scale factor a and translation b.
By such trans-
lation and scaling, mother wavelet separates mixed fre-
quency components of given PPG segment. Since an-
alytic wavelets are more suitable for oscillatory signal
and morse wavelet can approximate many other analytic
wavelets by selecting appropriate parameters, in exper-
iments ‘Analytic Morse’ wavelet was used as mother
wavelet.
• Dimensionality Reduction: Linear discriminant analy-
sis (LDA) based dimensionality reduction was applied on
features vectors generated in previous stage. CWT along
with LDA emphasizes time-frequency behavior in such a
way that it increases the inter subject variability and re-
duces the intra subject variability. Such features selection
is also important because PPG being physiological signal
changes with time. Prior to dimensionality reduction, fea-
tures were normalized on time axis using zero padding.
Given a training set Z = {Zj}K
j=1 containing K classes
each having Zk={zki}Nk
i=1 where Nk is number of feature
vectors for each class k, LDA finds projection weight W
that maximizes the fisher criterion function J(W),
J(W) = arg max
W
|W T SbW|
|W T SwW|
(3)
here Sb and Sw are the between class and within class
scatter matrix respectively defined as,
Sb =

�
i=1
(zki − µk)(zki − µk)T
(5)
where µk= 1
Nk
�Nk
i=1 zki is mean of class Zk and µ is
overall mean vector. LDA finds W as m=K-1 most sig-
nificant eignevectors of (Sw)−1(Sb) that corresponds to
first m largest eigenvalues. After obtaining weight W, all
the input training PPG segments are subjected to linear
projection of ˜z = W T z. In practice, number of features
might be larger than number of training samples. In that
case, LDA suffers from small sample size problem. We
used Direct-LDA (DLDA) to address this issue[11]. Pro-
jected training vectors ˜z together with weight W is saved
in gallery for template matching.
2.3. Template Matching
Prior to template matching of test data, it is passed
through all the blocks i.e. pre-processing and template cre-
ation. Weights of the LDA is pre-saved from the training
session and test feature vectors are projected in similar way.
Template matching is carried out using Pearson’s distance
between training templates and test vectors. Pearson’s dis-
tance Sp between two vectors a and b is defined as:
Sp(a, b) = 1 −
cov(a, b)
�
cov(a, a).cov(b, b)
(6)
where cov(a, b) is the covariance matrix of a and b. Test
vector is accepted if Sp ≤ threshold.
3. Other Implemented Methods
Apart from DLDA, few other techniques were also im-
plemented to reproduce and compare the results.
• DWT/kNN: It is based on method presented in [4] by
Karimian et.al. It is a non-fiducial method which uses
DWT coefficients extracted using coiflet wavelet from
PPG segment as features. It implements two steps pro-
cess based on kolmogrov smirnov based correlation filter
(ksCBF) and Kernel PCA (KPCA) to remove correlated
features and to reduce dimensionality. Classification is
carried out using local density factor based kNN.
• AC/LDA [3]: It is widely used in ECG based recognition
system. It doesn’t require peak detection in PPG. Instead,
signal is blindly segmented into overlapping windows
of predefined length. Then, normalized auto-correlation
(AC) of each window is calculated as following:
ˆ
Rxx[m] =
�N−|m|−1
i=0
x[i] x[i + m]
ˆ
Rxx[0]
(7)
where, x[i] represents windowed PPG singal, x[i+m] de-
layed PPG singal with time lag of m = 0, 1, 2.....M − 1
and M << N. These AC windows are projected on
lower dimensional space using LDA. Finally template
matching is done with euclidean distance.

• Openset Validation:
It follows same system as de-
cribed in Fig.3 except doing dimensionality reduction. In
openset validation, CWT PPG feature segments are stored
in gallery without subjecting them to dimensionality re-
duction. During template matching, same process is fol-
lowed and CWT features of claimed person is compared
against CWT feature segments stored in gallery without
projecting them to any lower dimensional space.
• Other Subspace Learning Techniques:
Apart from
DLDA other subspace learning techniques such as PCA,
LDA, KPCA and Kernel Direct Discriminant Analysis
(KDDA) [8] were also implemented. For all of these tech-
niques same system as Fig.3 was followed with DLDA di-
mensionality block replaced with different technique. For
both KPCA and KDDA, Gaussian kernel was used. Re-
duced dimensionality of all these techniques was set to
N − 1, where N is number of subjects in dataset.
4. Experimental Results and Discussion
4.1. Performance Metric
The performance of all techniques was evaluated in ver-
ification mode (1 to 1 matching).
In this configuration,
subject can claim an enrolled ID and based on matching
score system rejects or accepts the claim. In this setting,
error can be characterized by False Rejection Rate (FRR)
and False Acceptance Rate (FAR). ROC (Receiver Oper-
ating Characteristic) curve plots FRR vs FAR for different
operating points. Operating points are matching score or
threshold values. Trade off appears between FAR and FRR.
EER (Equal Error Rate) is an operating point on ROC where
FAR=FRR. For experiments, EER is chosen as a metric to
compare different techniques. In practice, choice of operat-
ing point is application dependent.
4.2. Results
In experiments, evaluation strategy was designed such
that it addressed the issues of robustness against different
stress conditions, against time and speed.
To assess the
system performance against all such conditions, three dif-
ferent datasets were used. All of three datasets contained
data recorded in single session, in different emotional stress,
physical stress and data recorded after time-lapse. In exper-
iments, we ran multiple simulations varying different pa-
rameters such as CWT scale, segment length, distance met-
ric etc. It was also found that using larger segment length
gave better results in general, since CWT gave better fre-
quency resolution. Segment length was set based on me-
dian HR such that it covered 3.5-4 cycles of PPG. In addi-
tion, two consecutive time segments were averaged. This
reduced variance due to noise in larger segment and across
whole period for one subject. Experimental results also sup-
ported this hypothesis. One more engineering problem was
to select number of scales from CWT to maximize discrim-
ination while keeping feature vector small. It was found
that choosing coefficients from only one scale, which filters
signal between 1-2 Hz gave better results. 1-2 Hz is also
most prominent frequency range of PPG signal. However
due to diverse nature and different sampling frequency of
each of three dataset, best CWT scale for classification was
different for each of the three dataset.
Another challenge is of speed.
PPG is slower signal
compared to traditional biometric traits and requires larger
training and testing time. In experiments taking more prag-
matic approach, average training time was limited between
45 − 60s. On the other side to assess effect of limited au-
thentication time, different number of test segments were
selected to vary available test time. Experimental results
for each of three dataset under various configurations is pre-
sented in subsequent discussions.
Capnobase dataset was used for single session evaluation
[5]. It consists of 8 minute single session data recorded in
relax condition from 42 subjects. Training time was fixed
to first 45s of signal, while different number of consecu-
tive test segments (nTest) were selected randomly over 50
iterations. EER was calculated for each iteration. To select
best scale, numerous experiments were carried out varying
training time, nTest and CWT Scale. Based on these ex-
periments 3rd highest scale was chosen for further exper-
iments. Similar experiments were also carried out to se-
lect best scale for other two datasets. Results in Tab.1 and
2 present mean EER and standard deviation in EER (std.

CWT/DLDA performed better than every other technique.
During the experiments, it was found the increasing train-
ing time decreased EER. However, drop wasn’t significant.
Also, increasing testing time (nTest) also decreased EER.
Nevertheless, EER of 1.12±0.44% was achieved using 45s
of training and just 2 segments which required 6-7s in time.
Next, system was tested for emotional robustness us-
ing DEAP Dataset [7].
DEAP dataset consists of data
recorded in 40 different kinds of emotions spread over va-
lence arousal plane for 32 subjects. Data was recorded on
same day with short breaks and baseline emotional stim-
uli in between. For each subject, model was trained us-
ing data recorded in one type of emotion, that is total one
minute of training of data and tested it against rest of the
dataset. For each subject, dataset consisted of 39 genuine
trials and 1240 (40 data samples from rest of the 31 sub-
jects) imposter trials. EER was calculated over 40 itera-
tion, each time model trained with different emotion. Here,
nTest were not selected randomly, as test data were from
different sessions. Tab.3 presents mean EER and std. EER
for DLDA. Remarkably, EER of 2.61±1.14 % was achieved
using 60s of training time and 2 test segments or 6-7s of test
time. Fig.4 presents comparison of different techniques us-
ing ROC curves. It can be noticed that all other techniques
performed poorly compared to DLDA. Also CWT/DLDA
produced better result than [9] on same dataset.
Apart from emotions, PPG signal is susceptible to vari-
ations due to exercise because of heart rate change. For ro-
bust system, these variations can not be overlooked. In ad-
dition, as shown in Fig.5, PPG being physiological signal,
changes with time. Therefore, consequences of ignoring it
can be disastrous. Like all other biometrics traits, perma-

nence test on PPG is important. Since, no large dataset is
available in public to estimate the effect of physical stress
and time-lapse, BioSec.Lab PPG dataset was developed at
University of Toronto [1]. PPG signals were recorded from
fingertip using Plux Sensor over two sessions [2]. First ses-
sion was conducted in two parts. First, PPG was recorded
in relax condition for 3 minutes. Then subjects were asked
to perform some form of intense exercise such as climb-
ing up the stairs very fast to increase HR. PPG signal was
again recorded for 3 minutes just after exercise. In total 41
subjects participated in first session. In second session, sig-
nals were only recorded in relax condition for 3 minutes.
Two sessions were separated atleast 2 weeks apart in time.
However only 34 subjects out of 41 participated in second
session. For evaluation, Model was trained using only ini-
tial 45 seconds of relax data from first session. To assess,
effect of physical stress, model was then tested on exercise
data with different nTest selected from the initial signal non-
randomly. To estimate time-robustness, again model was
trained using 45 seconds of relax data from first session and
then tested on session 2 data non-randomly. Tab.4 presents
results for each case where single session performance on
45 seconds of training data is included for comparison.
From Tab.4, it can be observed that EER increased by
5% because of time-lapse and exercise when tested with
whole signal.
However, from Fig.6 it can be seen that,
CWT/DLDA performed far better than any other tech-
nique. Surprisingly, DWT/kNN method, which performed
very badly for DEAP dataset, had decreasing EER for
BioSec.Lab dataset, across different sessions. This can be
due to that fact that correlation based filter empolyed in this
method does not take into account robustness of features
across sessions while removing them. Hence it is possi-
ble that because of reduced number of features, DWT/kNN
gave decreasing error across 2 sessions for BioSec.Lab
dataset, but on average when tested across 40 sessions in
DEAP dataset, it performed worst.
Also, ideally EER
should decrease with increase in nTest. This trend is vis-
ible in Tab.1. But in Tab.3 and Tab.4, it is not consistent.
This is due to the quality of samples. For example in Tab.4
across exercise, nTest= 20 has lower EER compared to All
test segments. Because, it is possible that whole test sig-
nal (all segments) would have more deviated samples under
physical or mental stress compared to only subset (e.g. 20
segments) of test signal.

5. Conclusion
In this paper, CWT/DLDA based method was presented
for PPG based authentication. By nature, CWT reveals id-
iosyncratic time-frequency behavior of PPG for each indi-
vidual. To get holistic understanding, method was evalu-
ated for different datasets under different conditions. It was
found that, system performed better with larger training and
testing time. However by considering more practical sce-
nario training time was fixed to only 45-60s. Better results
of our method compared to previous works is attributed to
the fact that, analytic wavelet are more suitable for oscil-
latory signals compared to non-analytic and DLDA boosts
system performance by only choosing features that maxi-
mizes discriminality in class specific way. It was found that,
physical stress and time-lapse has adverse effect on system.
In future, we plan to address these issues with more ro-
bust feature selection, continuous authentication and train-
ing model under many different conditions.
