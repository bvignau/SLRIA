Abstract— A preliminary study on photoplethysmogram 
(PPG) based biometry system is presented here. PPG is a 
physiological signal related to cardiac output and blood flow 
saturation in body. Recently it is reported that being an 
automatic physiological phenomenon PPG and other biosignals 
can be used as biometric parameters for human authentication. 
In this work, 12 number of features are extracted from filtered 
PPG and its derivatives and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) 
is used for classification over the statistical parameters extracted 
from the feature set. 100% accuracy is achieved for 15 number of 
data captured using Biopac MP 45. 
Keywords— Biometric authentication, PPG, standard deviation, 
Linear Discriminant Analysis  
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Biometric system based on physical or behavioral 
characteristics of a human being is more reliable and more 
secure system than the traditional identification technology 
[1]. In literature several physiological and behavioral 
characteristics are used as biometric features such as, face [2], 
fingerprint [3], palmprint [4], palm vein [5], iris [6], ECG [7], 
EEG [8] and so on. These applications based on biometric 
approaches provide a promising and convincing future of 
human recognition. However, a fingerprint can be modified 
with latex, face recognition can be faked with an artificially 
disguised, audio recorder can be used for voice [9], and the 
EEG and ECG-based methods are to some extent complicated 
to acquired the bio-signals. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a 
non-invasive electro-optical methodology which provides 
information concerning the amount of blood changes in the 
micro vascular bed of tissue at the skin surface initiated by the 
heart [10]. Compared with other biometric approaches, PPG 
based technique has many distinct advantages like low 
development cost, easy to use without any complicacy, and 
suitably accessible. Moreover, PPG signals offer  a 
noninvasive and correct methodology to get valuable 
physiological information like heart rate, and blood flow [11] 
etc. 
In literature, few approaches based on PPG are proposed 
so far. Gu et al. [12] offered a new approach of human 
verification using the PPG signals acquired simply from the 
finger-tips and obtained four feature parameters from digitized 
PPG signals of 17 healthy subjects and finally achieved 94% 
success on verification by applying Euclidean distance. In 
another study [13] a fuzzy-logic based approach is proposed to 
examine the feasibility of the application of PPG signals as a 
new method in the identification of humans. Yao et al. [14] 
suggested derivatives of PPG signals can certainly indicate the 
features of one's PPG signal and can be used as biometrics for 
recognition. Spachos et al. [15] demonstrated that PPG signals 
can be used as bio-measures for identification purposes if PPG 
signals are collected under controlled environment and with 
accurate sensors. Bonissi et al. [16] presented a preliminary 
study on continuous biometric authentication techniques based 
on PPG signals by using simple and fast correlation technique 
and also suggested that PPG signal can be used as biometric as 
sufficient discrminability present in it. Kavsaoğlu et al. [17] 
proposed a feature ranking algorithm for a sum of 40 time 
domain features, acquired from first and second derivatives of 
the PPG signal for biometric identification and calculates the 
contribution of each feature to biometric recognition. In 
another work, Jaafar et al. [18] proved the robustness and 
reliability of Acceleration Plethysmogram signal as a 
biometric recognition system by acquiring data from 10 
subjects and achieved 97.5% identication rate. 
In the present work, a preliminary study with 15 healthy 
subjects is made where the feasibility of using 1st and 2nd  
derivative based features of PPG for biometric analysis is 
tested using linear discriminant analysis based classification 
technique. 
II. METHODOLGY 
Data are collected from 15 healthy subjects of ages 
between 20 and 45 under normal relax state, by using 
BiopacMP 45 [19] data acquisition system consisting of an 
LED and a photo detector is attached on the fingertip (right 
index finger). PPG signals are recorded continuously for about 
three minutes from each person and converted into digital 
signals at the sampling rate of 1K samples. To minimize 
motion artifact, the subjects are encouraged to keep their 
fingers still.  
The general block diagram of biometric recognition system 
based on PPG signal is shown in Fig. 1. PPG signal of a 
subject is collected, which is act as a raw data input. The raw 
data are preprocessed using a low pass FIR filter. 
The Preprocessing stage removes or suppresses noise like 
power line interference from the raw input.

Next the first and the second derivative signals are 
calculated from the normalized filtered PPG signal. Unique 
features are extracted from the normalized filtered PPG and its 
derivatives.  These features are used for the purpose of 
classification. The proposed algorithm is elaborated below. 
A. Data Processing 
In order to immune the noises in the PPG signal, the raw 
data are preprocessed by using a 2nd order low-pass 
Butterworth filter of 10 Hz cut-off frequency which is shown 
in Fig. 2.

a) Original PPG Signal, b) Filtered PPG Signal 
B. Feature Extraction 
After filtering, filtered PPG signal f(n) is normalized in the 
interval [0, +1] by a standard method to obtain a shape 
response function fnorm(n).   
Next, the first and second derivatives of the PPG are 
calculated from the normalized filtered PPG signal (fnorm(n)) 
using the following formulas, 
For first derivative,

Then the points of maximum amplitudes A and B (Fig. 3a) 
as two consecutive peak points are detected. The starting point 
of these two consecutive peaks is detected by searching the 
closest to zero point just before h in the first derivative plot so 
that two complete pulses can be picked up by the data set. 
Pulse interval (tpi) is calculated by measuring the time 
difference of starting points of two complete consecutive 
pulses and by measuring the time difference between systolic 
peaks of two consecutive pulses, peak to peak time (tpp) is 
achieved.

However, the Dicrotic notch (b) and Diastolic peak (c) are 
detected by using second derivative PPG signal as shown in 
Fig. 4.

2nd derivative PPG signal 
In most cases, the largest minimum points within the 
second order derivative correspond to the systolic peaks and 
the maximum point following these typically corresponds to 
the dicrotic notch (b). The timing of the dicrotic notch (t2) is 
located as the timing of the maximum point in second 
derivative plot following the systolic peak in each pulse 
cycle. After that, diastolic peak (c) is detected at the point of 
inflection within the second order derivative following the

dicrotic notch point and corresponding time is identified as 
diastolic time (t3). The systolic-diastolic peak-to-peak time 
(ΔT) is then calculated.  
After finding systolic and diastolic peak, augmentation 
index is defined as the ratio c to a, whereas alternative 
augmentation index is defined as the ratio of (a-c) to a. Next, 
pulse width (d) is detected at the semi height of the systolic 
peak. A typical normalized PPG signal is shown in Fig. 5.

Characteristic features acquired from PPG signal 
C. Feature-based Template Generation 
A typical normalized PPG signal is shown in Fig. 5. 
Twelve feature parameters are extracted from the PPG signals 
of each subject (see Fig. 5). The twelve features are defined as 
follows: 
1. a (systolic peak) 
2. b (dicrotic notch) 
3. c (diastolic peak) 
4. c/a (augmentation index) 
5. (a-c)/a (alternative augmentation index) 
6. d (the pulse width) 
7. tpi (pulse interval) 
8. tpp (peak to peak) 
9. t1 (systolic peak time) 
10. t2 (dicrotic notch time) 
11. t3 (diastolic peak time) 
12. ΔT (time between systolic and diastolic peaks) 
These twelve features are divided into two sets. The first 
set consists of first six features whereas the last six features 
are incorporated in the second set.  
These two feature sets can be individually analyzed to 
develop the feature template for each subject. Variance, 
standard deviations etc. among the features of each set are the 
most popular statistical features in this kind of studies. In the 
present case, the enrollment template vector consisting of 
standard deviations of two sets of feature parameters is 
formulated for each subject as shown in Fig. 6, where F1 to 
F12 stands for feature 1 to feature 12. 
   
 
Fig. 6. 
PPG Template Vector 
 
The verification is carried out by comparing the sample 
vector obtained at different periods of time with the template 
feature vector. The final decision is made based on the Linear 
Discriminant Classifier. 
Twelve feature values and two standard deviation (Std) 
values of 15 subjects are shown in the Table I and Table II.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In this work, data are collected from 15 subjects by using 
Biopac MP 45 data acquisition system for about three minutes. 
In between these three minutes of data the first one and half 
minutes of the data of each subject are used for training, 
whereas the next one and half minutes of data of each subject 
are used as testing. 
During testing, projected new sample template vector is 
transformed and Euclidean distance of the transformed sample 
template vector from each class mean is computed.  
Thus, for 15 classes 15 Euclidean distances are obtained 
and the smallest one among the 15 distances is used to identify 
the new sample vector. The proposed method is tested and 
validated against all 15 subjects and acquired 100% success 
rate. Euclidean distance for 15 sample template vector among 
the entire enrollment template vector is shown in Table III. 
Fig. 7 shows the mean of enrollment data sets of each 
subject in transformed space along with the transformation 
axis. This figure clearly justify that transformation provide 
boundary for proper classification. For a large number 
database, 
where 
overlap 
occurs 
between 
classes, 
transformation along largest eigenvector axis proves very 
essential.

IV. CONCLUSION 
Biometric identification system uses distinctive human 
characteristics like face, iris, fingerprint, gait, etc. to identify. 
However, all these systems may be compromised by 
exploitation faux credential and not proof against spoof 
attacks. Therefore, to stop spoofing biosignals are used as they 
cannot be artificially generated and guaranteed liveliness made 
the system advantageous over other systems. In this paper a 
preliminary study on Photoplethysmograpm (PPG) based 
biometry system is reported. Here standard deviations of 
temporal and special features are separately calculated for 
classification. The work is done under a small database of 15 
persons and achieved 100% accuracy. 
However, further research based on large database is 
needed and to present a more reliable biometric system PPG 
may be used as one of the attributes in a multimodal biometric 
system.
