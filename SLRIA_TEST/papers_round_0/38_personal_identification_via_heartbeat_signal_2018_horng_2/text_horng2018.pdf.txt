INTRODUCTION
The biometric system plays an important role in network 
security issues. The uniqueness of each individual was needed 
to improve the security system applications. Instead of using 
password for access control, biometric identification can be 
used for authentication. Biometric information is hard to be 
duplicated, lost, forgotten, shared or transferred because it is 
a part of human body. Unfortunately, hackers can possibly get 
into 
system 
via 
counterfeit 
biometric 
information. 
Fingerprints can be affected by chemical reactions for the 
people who are working in the industry. Furthermore, 
biometric identification system using voice can be changed 
seriously due to aging and health condition. Finally, EEG and 
ECG-based methods are impractical as various electrodes are 
required in order to acquire the bio-signals.
In this study, the photoplethysmography (PPG) signal was 
used for data input that is capable of implementing 
identification functionality. The advantage of using the PPG 
signal is widely used; it is easier and more affordable price 
sensors.
The method proposed for biometric recognition in this 
study is composed by data acquisition, pre-processing, PPG 
signaling and the feature extraction of PPG signal using 
smoothing PPG signal and its first and second derivatives. The 
process of data acquisition was provided by 50 volunteers 
through a PPG data acquisition card. Existing approaches are 
reviewed in the following.
Gu et. al. [1] provided a new approach of human 
verification using the PPG signals acquired easily from the 
fingertips. For the group consisting of 17 healthy subjects, 
they performed experimental studies by obtaining four feature 
parameters from digitized PPG signals. A feature vector 
template was formulated using the recorded signals, and later 
on, the discriminant function was applied in order to verify the 
data. This promising method of human identification finally 
achieved a 90% success. 
In Yao et. al. [2], two important conclusions like the 
derivatives of PPG signals, and the consistency of subjects 
within themselves and the distinguishability among different 
subject are examined. Data taken using Pulse Oximeter Sensor, 
statistically the results of same subject have a constant time 
interval against the generated maximum/minimum points, and 
the derivatives can certainly indicate the features of one's PPG 
signal and can be used as biometrics for recognition.
In Spachos et. al. [3], on the other hand, the feasibility of 
the application of PPG signal as a single biometrical feature 
along with the signal-processing methods for the matter 
involved is being researched. The PPG signals were acquired 
from the fingertips of 29 healthy subjects using BvpPLUX 
System from OpenSignal PPG Dataset and also using NONIN 
pulse oximeter from BioSec PPG Dataset. The classification 
was applied using the Nearest Neighbor and Majority Voting 
for the data to match the input signal. The accuracy results of 
identification depend on the dataset used. This can occur 
because of the influence of the circuit, the sensor and the 
current state of data collection. The experimental results 
suggesting biometrics for identification can be used when 
PPG signals come under a controlled environment with 
infallible sensors.
Wei et. al. [4] addressed that PPG signals could reflect
numerous physiological parameters, such as heart functions, 
blood vascular elasticity and blood viscosity. This is a new 
non-invasive method with the advantages like smoothness and 
accuracy. It is important to find out efficient pre-processing

and feature extraction algorithms in order to deal with the 
original PPG signal that could be affected by many other 
factors. Most of the practical methods include median and FIR 
(Finite Infinite Response) filtration. In this study, a new 
algorithm is recommended in order to eliminate the wavelet 
transform-based baseline deviation, like a sophisticated 
differential algorithm that created an effective platform for 
determining the physiological parameters. 
Gu et. al. [5] had showed a fuzzy-logic approach to 
examine the feasibility of the application of PPG signals as a 
new method in the identification of humans. The PPG signals 
were acquired from the fingertips of 17 healthy subjects and 
were used as fuzzy entries for the classification of four 
distinctive features such as the peak number, the upward slope, 
the downward slope, and the time interval. This fuzzy-based 
decision-making can reach up to 94% in the same testing and 
82.3% for two different trials. This result suggests that this 
new PPG-based biometry is potentially feasible in the 
verification of humans. 
In Wan et. al. [6], the design of an amplifier circuit 
intended for extracting the DC component of the signal is 
being negotiated for PPG signals. Consequently, a high AC 
signal with SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) is acquired from a raw 
PPG signal, adding a bias-adjusted circuit to the amplifier. 
This hardware development resulted in acquiring a better 
signal quality and a data handling convenience in recognition 
(identification). 
In Singh et. al. [7], the fingerprint of someone could be 
imitated by placing a thin film or using the artificial copy of 
that print in a biometric system operating via finger scanning. 
The uniqueness of a finger impact profile was approved in the 
preliminary studies. This study creates researches into the 
possibility to utilize the PPG signal as an additional parameter 
along with the fingerprint.
Kavsaoglu et. al. [8] got data using a microcontroller and 
sensors DCM03 then using k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbor) to do 
classification. Forty different features were used for feature 
extraction stage, including augmentation index, systolic and 
diastolic peak, pulse width, and peak-to-peak interval. When 
the results were evaluated for the k-NN classifier model 
created along with the proposed algorithm, an identification 
of 90.44% for the 1st configuration, 94.44% for the 2nd 
configuration, and 87.22% for the 3rd configuration has 
successfully been attained.This template provides authors

APPROACH
A.
Data Acquisition
In this study, PPG signals are acquired from a total of 
fifty one healthy volunteers, and twenty one of them are male 
and the remaining persons are female. The data are obtained 
from their right index fingers while they are seated in a calm 
position. Total 90-period-signal is acquired from each 
individual at two different time spans. 30 characteristic 
features are extracted for each period and these characteristic 
features are used for the purpose of classification.
B.
Identification System of PPG Signals
The block diagram of the identification system using 
PPG signals is shown in Figure 1. In this system, the PPG 
signals are acquired by an Arduino and a pulse sensor with a 
5 Hz sampling frequency. In order to debug the noises in the 
PPG signal as a pre-processing, a band-pass filter out of 3rd 
order Butterworth low-pass and high-pass filters with cutoff 
frequencies of .8Hz and 5Hz is utilized. Low order 
polynomial polyfit and the polynomial polyval are used to 
detrend the signal with obvious baseline drift. This drift is 
mainly caused by the breath signal and the motion artifact. A 
Polynomial method is proposed to eliminate the influence of 
the breath signal. The result of the polynomial reconstruction 
method is shown in Figure 2.

The method for detecting the peaks is implemented in 
MATLAB®. Peaks detection is implemented using the 
function findpeaks, in which, the data of heartbeat have to be 
input and there are two input arguments have to be defined as 
shown in Figure 3. The MinPeakDistance defines the 
function used to specify the minimum peak distance, or 
minimum separation between peaks as a positive integer. We 
can use the MinPeakDistance option to specify the small 
peaks that occur in the neighborhood of a larger peak. When 
we specify a value for MinPeakDistance, the algorithm 
initially identifies all the peaks in the input data and sorts 
those peaks in descending order. Beginning with the largest 
peak, the algorithm ignores all identified peaks not separated 
by more than the value of
MinPeakDistance. The 
MinPeakHeight function finds only those peaks that are 
greater than the value of MinPeakHeight. findpeaks only 
returns peaks that exceed the MinPeakHeight.

Figure 4: Peak detection result 
Figure 4(a) shows the original signal which results 
from the sensor with a baseline shift and therefore does not 
represent the true amplitude. In order to remove the trend, fit 
a low order polynomial to the signal and use the polynomial 
to remove the trend. Figure 4(b) shows the detrend PPG 
signal. Before peak detection step, determine the location of 
the each proposed peak. Thresholding the peaks to locate the 
proposed and required peaks can remove unwanted peaks 
caused by noise and it can be done by noise filtering 
techniques.  In this paper, Savitzky-Golay filtering is used to 
remove the noise in the signal and the result is shown in 
Figure 4(c). After detrending signal and noise filtering as 
shown in Figure 4(b) and 4(c), find the main-complex peaks, 
which are the most prominent repeating peaks in the PPG 
signal, such as systolic peak (maximum value), diastolic peak 
and minimum peak. Figure 4(d) shows the obtained peaks. 
The derivative for one-dimensional signals can be calculated 
by Equations 1 and 2. The graphs of the 1st and 2nd 
derivatives are shown in Figures 4(e) and 4(f), respectively. 
1st derivative :
��
�� = �(� + 1) − �(�)                               (1)
2nd derivative :
���
��� = �(� + 1) + �(� − 1) − 2�(�)
(2)
In Figures 5, we do some labels on the PPG signal and 
its corresponding first derivative and second derivative. For 
example, x, y and z labeling from smoothing signal represent 
the systolic peak, the diastolic peak and the minimum peak 
with their corresponding times labeled as t1, t2, and t3, 
respectively. The other features can be calculated by these 
major feature spots detected in the time domain. The time
between two systolic peaks is referred to as Time Peak to 
Peak (tpp). The distance between the beginning and the end 
of the PPG waveform of the ith cycle is labeled as Time Pulse 
Interval (tpi). The time between to diastolic peaks labeled as 
Time between Diastolic Peaks (tdp). Augmentation index (AI) 
is defined as a ratio calculated from the blood pressure 
waveform as the ratio of diastolic peak to systolic peak 
(diastolic peak/systolic peak). Takazawa et. al. [12] defined 
the augmentation index (AI ) as the ratio of y to x as in 
Equation 3. Rubins et. al. [13] used the reflection index as in 
Equation 4 and introduced an alternative augmentation index. 
For other features such as ɅT1, ɅT2 and ɅT3 corresponds to 
time between diastolic and systolic peaks, time between 
minimum and systolic peaks and time between minimum and 
diastolic peaks, respectively. And the remaining features are

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A. ���������������������
After processing each subject in the dataset, the 
extracted features are used as an input data in the 
classification stage. Four scenarios are used to test the 
accuracy of the system: training set, supplying test set, cross 
validation and percentage split. In the training set option, 
testing is performed by using the training data itself. In the 
cross-validation option, 10-fold is used. As for the percentage 
split option, from 90-period-signal, 66% is used for the 
training data and the rest is used for testing data. The data 
used for training and testing is chosen by the system itself. 
For the supplying test set option, from 90-period-signal taken,
70-period-signal of the initial data are used for training data 
and the remaining data are used for testing data. Furthermore, 
classification methods using Naïve Bayes, Multilayer 
Perceptron and Random Forest are proposed, respectively.
Table 2 the comparison of different classification 
methods to see how the performance varies across different 
architectures are shown. The performance results show 
accuracy (ACC), for the following architectures: Fuzzy, K-
nn, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron. 
The first column of Table 2 the performance for fuzzy logic 
by Gu et al. and the second column the performance for k-nn
by Kasgaovlu et al. are shown for seventeen subjects and 
thirty subjects, respectively. In our study, fifty one subjects 
joined for the experiments, this method can achieve good 
performance for more data samples. In this case, a 0.6 % 
increase in the classification success is attained, compared 
with Fuzzy logic method and a 0.16 % increase compared 
with K-nn method.
