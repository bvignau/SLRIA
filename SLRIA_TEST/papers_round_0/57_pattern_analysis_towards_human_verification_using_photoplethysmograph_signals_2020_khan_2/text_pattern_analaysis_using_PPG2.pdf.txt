Abstract— Photoplethysmogram (PPG) is a biomedical 
signal capable of detecting blood volume changes in the 
microvascular bed of tissues.  As PPG signals are more intimate, 
keen, hard to replicate, and steel, they are dedicated to 
providing a more secure biometric approach for user 
recognition. This work presents a low cost, nonintellectual 
pattern recognition system for biometric authentication. In the 
proposed methodology, raw PPG signals obtained from 20 
subjects are denoised using Empirical Mode Decomposition 
(EMD) and reconstructed using the first three IMFs. A 
combination of twenty time and frequency domain features is 
extracted from the preprocessed PPG signals. Subsequently, a 
range of different classifiers, including Support Vector 
Machines (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors 
(KNN), was used to classify the features extracted. When trained 
to quadratic SVM classifier using 10-fold cross-validation, the 
system achieves an accuracy of 93.10%.

I. INTRODUCTION 
In recent decades, security has become one of the 
challenging aspects faced by society. It is a burdensome issue 
for the researchers who work towards the development of 
smart systems. According to one research, in the US, security 
incidents have risen from 5,503 in 2006 to 67,168 in 2014 [1]. 
Hence, it is very crucial to develop such systems that can 
overcome the security challenge. In banking, military affairs, 
and traveling, these systems are broadly used [2]. The existing 
methods include passwords, codes, and identification cards to 
provide security. These techniques were not reliable because 
passwords, codes, and cards can be lost, forgot, or hacked by 
the hackers. 
Biometric identification systems were introduced in 1999 
[3]. ‘Biometrics’ is one of the emerging science which helps 
to demonstrate the individual’s identity [4]. The existing 
biometric systems used different traits of humans such as 
speech, fingerprints, iris, gaits, sound, DNA and genes for 
identification. All these systems had pros and cons as 
fingerprints and voice can be duplicated, iris patterns can be 
copied by lenses [5].  ECG [6] and EEG signals  were also 
used to identify individuals. Both these methods are 
impractical as many electrodes are required for acquiring 
these signals.  
In this paper, we present another biomedical signal known 
as Photoplethysmogram (PPG) for biometric identification. 
PPG is a non-invasive electro-optical method that gives 
information about blood volume flowing inside the body [7]. 
In contrast with other biomedical signals, PPG signals have 
various advantages that include low development cost, easy of 
availability on different parts of the human body and its easy 
algorithms [1] [2]. PPG provides accurate physiological 
information about heart rate, blood flow, and blood oxygen 
saturation [8]. This paper describes feature extraction after 
pre-processing of acquired PPG signals. Performance 
parameters were analyzed on the basis of accuracy and 
reliability. 
II. LITERATURE REVIEW 
Different 
authors 
used 
different 
techniques 
and 
biomedical signals for biometric identification. Some of them 
used fingerprints, iris, gaits for biometric identification while 
others used ECG or EEG signals for this purpose.  Biometric 
authentication with Brain waves is done by Ramaswamy [9] 
using novel two stage biometric authentication system on 5 
subjects that were involved in different activities. The system 
turns both false accept rate (FAR) and false reject rate (FER) 
to zero. Koksoon [10] proposes novel biometric method to 
identify a particular individual and to verify individual’s 
claimed identity. 99% of accuracy was obtained from HTK 
toolkit and 96% of accuracy was obtained using 1000 heart 
sounds. Chisei Miyamoto [11] uses spectral features of EEG 
for biometric authentication for 23 users. The proposed 
method gave verification rate of 79%. EEG [12] is used by 
Muhammad Kamil Abdullah for biometric authentication. 
Features were obtained using Wavelet Decomposition from 
10 male subjects which were then classified using Neural 
Network (NN) classifier. An accuracy of 81% was obtained. 
Sairul I. Safie [13] presents a novel framework method for 
authentication of 112 subjects using electrocardiogram 
signals. Pulse Active Ratio (PAR) feature extraction method 
give 10% better results when compared to conventional 
temporal and amplitude feature extraction methods.  
Hand based biometry [14] is introduced by Miguel A. 
Ferrer in his paper that authenticates 154 individual’s dataset 
obtained from SWIR camera in combination with optical 
spectrograph. Least Square Vector Machine (LSVM) 
classifier gives an identification rates of 96.71%. Qiong Gui 
 
 
in his paper [15] takes samples from 32 patients. Features of 
certain frequency were extracted using wavelet packet 
decomposition (WPD) and results were obtained using 
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Classifier which gave 
accuracy of 90%. Semih Ergin [16] from 18 healthy 
individuals ECG and used Decision Tree (DT) and Bayes 
Network (BN) Classifier which gave better performance 
results. Noureddine Belgacem [17] proposed Information 
fusion of 120 samples of EMG and ECG. Using Spectral 
Coefficients, features were extracted and classified using 
Optimum-Path Forest (OPF) classifier which give 99.0% 
accuracy. Biometric Authentication using ECG [18] is also 
done by Adam Page who performed filtering of 310 samples 
using FIR Band-Pass Filter and then classified using Neural 
Network (NN) Classifier. When tested system gave accuracy 
of 99.54%. Electromyograph and Keystroke Dynamics 
fusion technique for Biometric Authentication is presented  in 
[19]. Data set from 14 individuals were classified using 
Subspace Modeling and Bayesian Classifier which gives 
Genuine Accept Rate (GAR) above than 90%. Krzysztof 
Rzecki [20] proposed biometric authentication using touch 
screen gestures. The data obtained from 50 persons was 
preprocessed using resampling, standardization and Principal 
Component Analysis (PCA) and then computational 
intelligence methods were applied which gave an accuracy 
ranging between 96.60% to 99.29%. 
Zhidong Zhao [21] proposed biometric authentication 
using Convolution Neural Network and S- Transformation of  
ECG signals obtained from 50 persons obtaining accuracy of 
99%. ECG Biometrics is used by Ateke Goshvarpour [22] 
who collected 90 ECG samples and then decomposed them 
using matching pursuit (MP) and several statistical and 
nonlinear measures. The results were determined using 
Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and k-Nearest Neighbor 
(K-NN) classifier which gave accuracy of 99.68%. The paper 
written by Vidhyapriya R [23] proposes finger knuckle point 
method for biometric authentication of individuals. Texture 
features were classified using (SVM) classifier which gives 
98% accuracy. 
Table I shows the previous work cited for biometric 
authentication. It can be seen that ECG and EEG signals were 
used in previous literature cited but both of them addresses 
many issues i.e. variability and heritability of both signals and 
lack of standardization of ECG and EEG features. The 
organization of paper is as follows. Section II describes the 
previous work cited. Adopted methodology is discussed in 
Section III. Results are presented in Section IV followed by 
conclusion in Section V. 
III. METHODS AND MATERIALS 
Fig. 1 shows the methodology used for biometric 
authentication using PPG signals. PPG signals were acquired 
from 20 healthy subjects using Photoplethysmography (PPG) 
sensor. The obtained signals were preprocessed using 
Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) technique. EMD 
decomposes the raw signals to its constituent IMF’s. As, 
higher IMF’s contain low frequency artifacts hence, original 
signal was reconstructed using lower IMF’s to avoid these 
artifacts. After preprocessing, discriminative features were 
extracted from the signals using time domain and frequency 
domain features. In the end, the features of all subjects were 
trained to SVM classifier which gives accuracy of 
experiments.

A. Data Acquisition 
In this experiment, Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals 
were acquired using SS4L Photoplethysmography sensor 
along with MP36 BIOPAC system. 
PPG is an optical measurement method used for 
observing blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of 
tissues [24]. It uses photodetector at the surface of skin to 
measure changes in light absorption. Pressure pulse due to 
change in volume is detected by illuminating the skin through 
light emitting diode (LED) and then light reflected is 
measured using a photodiode. 
In this case, PPG signals were recorded in a sitting 
position at a resting state. Each signal was 30 minutes long, 
digitized at the sampling frequency of 200Hz. A total of 20 
subjects (11 males and 9 female) participated in our 
experiments. We acquired the PPG signals from subject’s 
index finger of right hand. Table II shows the detail of 
acquired dataset. Fig. 2 shows the data acquisition from 
BIOPAC System using PPG Sensor. Fig. 3 and 4 shows the 
PPG signal of subject I and II in time domain and frequency 
domain.  
B. Preprocessing 
Acquired PPG signals needs to be preprocessed because 
they contain both environmental noise and motion artifacts.

Preprocessing of acquired PPG signals involves two 
operations, de-noising of raw signals and region of interest 
(ROI) extraction. In our experiment, we used Empirical Mode 
Decomposition (EMD) technique to achieve both these 
objectives [25, 26].  
EMD also known as Huang Transform decomposes the 
signals into intrinsic and simple oscillations known as 
Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF’s) [27, 28]. In our study, IMF-
4 is rejected to avoid low frequency artifacts. whereas 1st 
three IMF’s are selected. Fig. 5 and 6 shows the IMF’s of 
subject I and subject II. Fig.7 and 8 shows the PPG signal of 
subject I and II after preprocessing.  
C. Feature Extraction 
After preprocessing, discriminant features were extracted 
from the signals to present minimum parameters of subjects 
with high discriminative properties. In our experiment, we 
extracted 20 different time domain and frequency domain 
features including Mean, Kurtosis (Kur), Spectral Mean 
(SMean), Spectral Standard Deviation (SStd), Spectral 
Skewness (SSk), Spectral Kurtosis (SKr), Log Energy 
(LE_E), Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), Mean Absolute 
Deviation (MeanAD), Spectral Centroid (SCen), Zero 
Crossing Rate (ZCR), Higuchi Fractal Dimensions (HFD), 
Waveform Length Ratio (WLR), Sparseness, Irregularity, 
Difference Absolute Standard Deviation Value (DASDV), 
Root Sum of Squares (RSSQ), Inter-Quartile Range (IQR), 
Mean Frequency, Willison Amplitude (WA). Combination of 
all these features help to extract discriminant features of 
signals and to improve our classification accuracy. Table III 
shows the features we selected for achieving highest accuracy 
with less computational time.  
D. Classification 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is a binary 
classifier that separates data points of two classes in feature 
hyperspace by creating a linear decision boundary or a 
hyperplane. In this way, several hyperplanes are created that 
can classify the data. A Kernel Function K maps the input 
space to feature space and hence optimal boundary finds 
linear decision rule in Q feature space [29-31]. For reducing 
space and time complexity problems, SVM classifiers are 
widely used.

In our methodology, we trained our data set to different 
classifiers for attaining maximum accuracy. These classifiers 
include Quadratic Discriminant (QD), Linear Discriminant 
(LD), SVM-linear (SVM-L), SVM-Quadratic (SVM-Q), 
SVM-Cubic (SVM-C), SVM-Medium Gaussian (SVM-MG), 
Fine Tree (FT) and Naïve Bayes (NV). 
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Human Verification EMD-SVM based system using PPG 
signals is proposed in this paper. Presented method used 
Empirical Mode Decomposition technique for removing low 
frequency artifacts from acquired PPG signals. After this, set 
of 20 different time domain and frequency domain features 
are extracted and trained to different classifiers using 10 fold 
cross validation for achieving maximum accuracy. In 10 fold 
cross validation, entire data set is divided into 10 subsets of 
uniform lengths. Each subset is used as test set while 9 sets 
are used as a training set which after iteration of 10 times are 
averaged to form result. It is evident from table IV that 
Quadratic SVM gives maximum accuracy of 93.10%, while 
Linear SVM (SVM-L), Cubic SVM (SVM-C), Median 
Gaussian SVM (SVM-G) gives accuracies of 90.20%, 
92.10% and 89.70% respectively. The dataset is also 
evaluated on Fine Tree (FT), Quadratic Discriminant (QD) 
and Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier which gives accuracy of 
74.50%, 90.80% and 80.70% respectively.

V. CONCLUSION 
PPG based biometric authentication system is proposed 
in this research. The proposed system employed EMD for 
signal denoising and ROI extraction. The conjunction of 
frequency and time-domain features were extracted for the 
authentication of different data classes. The range of different 
classifiers was used to evaluate the selected features in which 
Quadratic-SVM achieved the highest classification accuracy 
of 93.10%. PPG dataset from 20 subjects was collected for 
this study. An experimental study shows that the proposed 
method is more feasible, accurate, and takes less 
computational time as compared to traditional methods used. 
In the future, we aim to expand the dataset in order to design 
a highly reliable embedded system for real-time applications 
based on the proposed methodology.
