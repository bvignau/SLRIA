Abstract—Recent studies in biometrics focus on one di-
mensional physiological signals commonly acquired in medical
applications, like electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalo-
grams (EEG), phonocardiogram (PCG), and photoplethysmo-
gram (PPG). In this context, an important application is in
continuous authentication scenarios since physiological signals
are frequently captured for long time periods in order to monitor
the health status of the patients.
With respect to other physiological signals, PPG data present
some advantages since they can be captured using widely dif-
fused, comfortable, and low-cost sensors.
In this paper, we present a feasibility study on continuous
authentication techniques based on PPG signals. A biometric
recognition method based on a correlation approach is first
presented. Then, the accuracy of this method is evaluated on
different datasets describing signals of variable time duration.
Finally, the performance of continuous enrollment strategies are
investigated.
The obtained results suggest that PPG signals present sufficient
discriminability to be used in biometric applications that do not
require very high accuracy. Moreover, the use of continuous
enrollment strategies can improve the performance of continuous
authentication systems.
I. INTRODUCTION
Biometrics is defined by the International Organization
for Standardization (ISO) as “the automated recognition of
individuals based on their behavioral and biological character-
istics” [1]. Some examples of commonly used characteristics,
called biometric traits, are fingerprint, iris, palmprint, DNA,
voice, and gait.
Recent studies in biometrics focus on the use of one-
dimensional physiological signals in recognition applications
[2]. In particular: the electrocardiogram (ECG) [3], electroen-
cephalogram (EEG) [4], phonocardiogram (PCG) [5], and
photoplethysmogram (PPG) [6–10].
These physiological signals are commonly acquired and
stored as part of the healthcare delivery process. In applicative
contexts like hospitals and body sensor networks [2], the use
of biometric systems based on physiological signals should
therefore permit to perform recognitions based on existing sen-
sors, without introducing additional costs. Another important
characteristic of the one-dimensional physiological signals is
that they can be used in continuous authentication systems
[11–13] since they can be captured for long time periods
without requiring any user’s cooperation. Other advantages
of these signals are that they can be acquired from all the
individuals and can be obtained only from living people [14].
With respect to the other commonly used one-dimensional
physiological signals, PPG data offer important advantages.
The acquisition of PPG signals, in fact, is performed in a
comfortable manner since the samples are captured using pulse
oximeters [15], which are non-invasive devices for monitoring
the hemoglobin saturation, and are usually attached to the
earlobe or fingertip. Moreover, the sensor placement does not
require the use of gels and the acquisition devices are widely
diffused in medical applications. Other advantages are that
pulse oximeters are usually less expensive and smaller in size
with respect to the acquisition devices used for the ECG, EEG,
and PCG signals. An example of PPG acquisition is shown in
Fig. 1.
In the literature, there are some preliminary studies on the
use of the PPG as a biometric trait [6–10]. The performed
analyses, however, are based on simple features and on small
datasets.
In this paper, we present a study on biometric recognition
techniques based on PPG signals. In particular, we consider
continuous authentication applications.
In this context, we propose a novel recognition technique
inspired to the ones used for the analysis of ECG signals.
First, a preprocessing step is applied in order to enhance the
distinctive characteristics of the PPG signal. The second step
is the feature extraction and computes a template describing a
defined number of distinctive heartbeats. Finally, the matching
is performed by using a correlation-based algorithm.
Experimental results prove that PPG signals present suf-
ficient discriminability to be used in biometric recognition
systems. Moreover, the analysis of signals related to long time
periods suggests that PPG can effectively be used to perform
continuous authentications if continuous enrollment strategies
are adopted.

II. RELATED WORKS
In the literature, there are studies on biometric recognition
methods based on different kinds of one-dimensional physio-
logical systems [2]. Most of them evaluate characteristics of
ECG [3] and EEG [4] signals. At the best of our knowledge,
there are only preliminary studies on PCG [5] and PPG [6–10]
signals.
With respect to the other mentioned physiological signal, the
use of PPG data has the advantage of requiring less expensive,
smaller, and more comfortable acquisition sensors.
In the context of biometric systems, PPG signals have been
mainly studied in order to design liveness detection techniques
[16,17].
The studies on biometric recognition methods based on PPG
signals have been performed by using small sample datasets
and algorithms inspired to medical analysis techniques. The
method presented in [6] computes the templates by using four
features: the peak number, upward slope, downward slope,
and time interval. The used matching function is based on the
Euclidean distance between the templates. The same features
are used in [9], but the matching technique is based on a fuzzy
system. The study presented in [7] uses feature sets composed
by the values of the local maximum, minimum, and inflection
points of PPG pulses in order to evaluate if samples of genuine
and impostor individuals present sufficient discriminability
for being used in biometric recognition systems. The method
described in [8] performs biometric recognitions by applying
the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) technique and using
nearest neighbor classifiers. Another study is presented in [10]
and it proposes the use of PPG-based biometric systems in
body area sensor networks and mobile healthcare systems. A
study on acquisition sensors specifically designed for biomet-
ric recognition is presented in [15].
At the best of our knowledge, there are no studies on the
use of PPG signals in continuous authentication systems and
the only continuous authentication techniques based on one-
dimensional physiological signals are described in [12,13].
These studies are based on commercial biometric recognition
systems. The method presented in [12] performs authentica-
tions based on ECG signals every 35 heartbeats and the one
detailed in [13] uses time intervals of 5 s.
In the literature, there are also studies on different biometric
traits that can be used in continuous authentication systems
[11]. In particular, the method presented in [18] evaluates
the face characteristics in scenarios in which the users are
working in front to a computer. A similar scenario is con-
sidered in [19], but the presented biometric technique is also
based on less distinctive characteristics obtained analyzing soft
biometric traits. The study described in [20] is also based on
a multimodal biometric technique, but considers the face and
fingerprint traits. Since samples of these traits can be captured
at different time intervals, a holistic strategy is proposed to
fuse the matching scores. A different data fusion strategy for
continuous authentication systems is presented in [21], and is
based on fuzzy systems.
III. THE PROPOSED METHOD
The proposed method permits to perform biometric recog-
nitions based on PPG signals in a simple and fast manner.
We have also implemented and evaluated more complex
techniques, obtaining similar results in terms of accuracy, but
increasing the needed computational time.
Similarly to most of the biometric systems in the literature,
the proposed method can be divided into the sequent steps:
acquisition, signal preprocessing, feature extraction, matching.
A. Acquisition
The acquisition process is performed with a NONIN Xpod
pulse oximeter [22], commonly used for medical diagnoses.
In the context of continuous authentication systems, the PPG
is continuously acquired and a sample is stored every t s. The
considered samples have a fixed time duration of t s.
Pulse oximeters, however, are sensitive to user’s movements
since the acquisition device needs a continuous contact with
the user’s skin. For this reason, it is necessary to define a
strategy for discarding poor quality samples. In this work, we
adopt a basic automatic procedure to discard samples with
insufficient quality. The data generated by the used pulse
oximeter include a binary signal representing the presence of
possible acquisition errors at every time instance. If a sample
presents at least an error state, it is considered as a failure
to acquire (FTA). An example of a 20 s sample acquired
during the user’s movement and the corresponding error states
generated by the acquisition device are shown in Fig. 2. It
is possible to observe that the portions of the signal near
to the errors detected by the pulse oximeter present spikes
and irregular shapes caused by the noise introduced by the
displacement of the sensor from the finger surface.
B. Signal preprocessing
The proposed method does not use complex preprocessing
algorithms.
The only executed task consists in the signal’s baseline
normalization, which is performed by applying a third order
high-pass Butterworth filter with cutoff frequency fc [23].
C. Feature extraction
This step computes a template T composed by a variable
number of distinctive heartbeats of the sample signal S. The
maximum number of heartbeat signals composing a template
T is equal to n.
The first task consists in the signal segmentation, which
permits to obtain a matrix H in which the points pertaining to
every heartbeat signal are stored in a distinct row. The peaks
are detected using a modified Pan-Tompkins algorithm. For a
given peak instant j, the heartbeat signal i is computed as:
H(i, 1 . . . t1 + t2) = S(j − t1 . . . i + t2),
(1)
where t1 and t2 are constant values empirically estimated on
the considered dataset.
The biometric template is finally obtained by applying an it-
erative algorithm. For each iteration, the signal ¯S representing
the mean heartbeat is computed as:
¯S(j) =
m
�
i=1
(H(i, j)) /m,
(2)
where m is the number of heartbeats present in the matrix
H.
A vector C representing the maximum cross-correlation
values between every heartbeat of H and the mean heartbeat
¯S is computed. A fixed number n of heartbeats corresponding
to the n maximum values of C are stored in the template
matrix T . If the correlation value of a heartbeat is less than
an empirically estimated threshold tc, the related signal is
removed from the template T .
In order to reduce the noise, this algorithm is repeated
two times. The second iteration aims to delete possible noisy
heartbeats and considers H = T . The number n is equal for
every iteration.
D. Matching
This step computes a similarity score s between two
templates TA and TB composed by nA and nB signals of
hearbeats, respectively.
A matrix M, composed by nAnB elements, is computed
by calculating the maximum cross-correlation between every
signal pertaining to TA and every signal pertaining to TB.

states of the pulse oximeter. It is possible to observe the presence of spikes
and noisy regions.
An example of matrix M obtained from a genuine identity
comparison of templates composed by two heartbeats is shown
in Fig. 3.
Finally, the matching score s can be obtained by applying
different data fusion strategies to the similarity values of M.
In this study, we have considered these simple techniques.
• Algorithm A: s = mean(M).
• Algorithm B: s = median(M).
• Algorithm C: s = 75th percentile(M).
• Algorithm D: s = 90th percentile(M).
• Algorithm E: s = 95th percentile(M).
• Algorithm F: s = max(M).
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In order to analyze the performance of the proposed method,
we have first evaluated the recognition accuracy in different
operative conditions and then analyzed the feasibility of a
continuous authentication systems based on PPG signals.
The used datasets have been captured in our laboratory. At
the best of our knowledge, in fact, there are no public datasets
of PPG signals with sufficient number of samples to properly
evaluate a biometric systems.
The parameters used for testing the recognition method are:
fc = 0.1 Hz, n = 16, t1 = 0.12 s, t2 = 0.24, and minimum
correlation threshold for the template computation is tc = 0.9.
A. Tuning of the recognition algorithms
In order to search the best configuration of the implemented
recognition algorithms, we have first evaluated the accuracy of
the biometric system on a dataset of short time signals captured
in our laboratory.
We have collected a set of 44 PPG signals from 44 individu-
als by using a NONIN Xpod pulse oximeter [22] with a finger
sensor. Every acquired signal has a duration of 2 minutes, a
resolution of 16 bit, and a sampling frequency of 75 Hz.
In order to evaluate the capability of the proposed recog-
nition method of working with sample signals of different
duration, three datasets have been created from the acquired

set of signals. The characteristics of these datasets are depicted
in Table I.
We have evaluated the accuracy of the recognition method
on the test datasets by using the implemented data fusion
strategies. In all the performed evaluations, Algorithm F
obtained the best accuracy. The DET curves obtained by
Algorithm F on the considered datasets are shown in Fig. 4,
while Table II reports the false match rate (FMR) and false
non-match rate (FNMR) in different working points.
From Fig. 4 and Table II, it is possible to observe that
the discriminability of PPG signals in short time periods can
be considered as satisfactory for many biometric applications.
Moreover, the obtained results show that the best accuracy
has been obtained on DB40, with an equal error rate (EER)
of 5.29%. The accuracy increasing with respect to the other
datasets should be due to the better capability of the proposed
method of reducing the effects of the noise due to user’s
movements. However, the smaller number of performed com-
parisons can also influence the obtained performances.
B. Preliminary test in continuous authentication scenarios
We have then evaluated the accuracy of the biometric
recognition method on a dataset composed by longer time
signals.

14 PPG signals from 14 individuals by using a NONIN Xpod
pulse oximeter. The duration of each acquisition is 15 minutes.
Considering the previously obtained results, the collected
signals have then been divided into samples of 40 s, obtaining
the dataset DB15m.
The results obtained by the best configuration of the pro-
posed method (Algorithm F) on DB15m are reported in Fig.
5 and Table III. It is possible to observe that the obtained
accuracy is inferior with respect the one achieved on DB40.
The obtained EER, for example, is equal to 13.47%.
The performance decreasing can be related to the time
variability of the biometric trait with the used features.
In order to evaluate this phenomena, we have analyzed the
performance of the presented algorithms in an ideal continuous
authentication scenario in which verifications are performed
at fixed time intervals and the enrolled templates are updated
after every verification. Differently from traditional procedures
used for the accuracy evaluation of biometric recognition
algorithms, which do not consider the time passed between
biometric acquisitions [24], this test permits to analyze the
stability and persistency of the used features during a defined
time interval. In this test, we have not used samples considered
as FTA since it only aims to evaluate the persistency of PPG

All the possible impostor identity comparisons have been
computed. For each time instant j, we have computed the
genuine matching score between the template T(i,j) and the
template T(i,j−∆t) obtained at the time instant j − ∆t:
G(i,j) = matching(T(i,j), T(i,j−∆t)).
(3)
The EER obtained with different values of ∆t are reported
in Fig. 6 and Table IV. The error obtained in other working
points is not reported since the accuracy evaluations consider
only small numbers of genuine identity comparisons.
From Fig. 6 and Table IV, it can be observed that the
accuracy of the recognition method is strictly related to the
time interval between the considered genuine comparisons
∆t. The obtained EER values, in fact, decrease from 9% to
14.5% in 320 s. The accuracy decreasing, anyway, is not linear
since poor quality samples and physiological changes could
influence the obtained results.
The performed preliminary tests suggest that the used fea-
tures have not sufficient durability for being used in traditional
biometric recognition scenarios. PPG signals, anyway, should
be used to perform continuous authentications by adopting
continuous enrollment strategies.

This kind of systems, however, require particular attention
in the design of privacy protection strategies since they can
be more easily attached by spoofing techniques with respect
to traditional biometric recognition methods [25].
V. CONCLUSION
This paper have presented a preliminary study on the use
of photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals in biometric systems
working in continuous authentication scenarios.
The proposed biometric recognition method is based on a
simple and fast correlation technique.
The recognition accuracy has been tested on sets of samples
with different time duration, with particular attention to the
analysis of the relation between the system accuracy and the
time passed between genuine acquisitions.
The obtained results suggest that PPG signals have sufficient
discriminability to be used in biometric recognition systems.
However, the analyzed features present low durability and
should therefore be used in continuous authentication systems
based on continuous enrollment strategies.
Further studies should regard the implementation of com-
plete continuous authentication systems based on PPG signals.
