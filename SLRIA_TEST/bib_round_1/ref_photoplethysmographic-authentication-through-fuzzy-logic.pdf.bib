INTRODUCTION Automatic human authentication using biometrics is an emerging important technology to secure human interactions with safety systems. Biometric approaches today have been made possible by the explosive advances in computing power, and have been made necessary by the widespread connection of computers all over the world. Traditional ways of authentication. primarily passwords and identification cards, though still remain essential. their inevitable drawbacks with low degrees of security result in unreliable verifications. Instead, biometric applications, which use unique human physical or behavioral characteristics to automatically identify a person},

  title = {Compared with other biometric approaches, PPG technique has several distinct advantages including low development cost, easy to use without any complicated procedure or special skill, and conveniently accessible to various sites of human body, such as finger, ear lobe, wrist or arm The specific aim of this work is to study the feasibility of this new PPG approach through fuzzy logic. 11. METHODOLOGY Experiments were conducted on seventeen healthy subjects aged 23-30. A reflective PPG probe. consisting of a LED and a photodetector, was attached on the fingertip (right index finger) by a belt. PPG siyals were recorded continuously for about one minute from each person. and converted into digital signals at the sanipling rate of IK samplesls. The raw data were preprocessed by filtering the low frequency and high frequency components. A t)vical PPG signal is shown in Fig. I. Four feature parameters -- peak number, time interval, upward slope and downward slope - were extracted from the PPG signals of each subject (see Fig. 1). The enrollment template vector consisting of four averaged feature parameters was formulated for each subject. The four features are defined as follows: Peak t, Fig. I: -1 typic31 PPG Siena! with 2 peaks on each pulse of hean mnlrsclion circle. 1) The peak number M: the number of peaks on each pulse: 2) The upward slope k, : the slope between the bottom of each waveform and the fust peak; 3) The downward slope kz : the slope between the last peak of each waveform and the bottom; 4) The time interval rl : the time interval between the bottom point and the first peak point; Fuzzy logic was implemented for decision-making. in which an output score was generated as the result of the comparison between the enrollment template and the newly generated one. The Gaussian Function was selected as the membership function (MF), which can be expressed as follows: where p is the averaged value of the ,ih feature paramete: of the irh subject. and U,, is the standard deviation of jrlz feature parameter of the i r h subject. The degree of membership for each feature parameter was determined by the maximum value of the overlapped area created by the Gaussian curves of the two templates. Fig. 2 shows an example to illusuate how the approach works: 0-7803-7944-6/03/$17.0002003 IEEE 136 The enrollment template parameter ist, = 1.852?0.076: while the newly generated template parameter is given bys, =1.784?0.057.

The verification was carried out under two situations: I ) the two templates were generated in the same trial but at different periods of time; and 2) the two templates were generated in two different trials. between two of which there was a few minutes' rest. 111. RESULTS A"DlSCUSSl0N Only one out of the seventeen subjects could not be verified correctly, if the two templates were within the same trial. For those generated from different trials, the successful rate can so far reach up to 82.3% (three out of seventeen could not be verified). These false rejections were mainly attributed to the poor quality of the signals from the subjects, perhaps due to respiration and motion artifacts, which resulted in some variations in the template feature vector and a large standard deviation (SD), and hence a small degree of membership. In this work, the PPG authentication as a new approach for human verification is investigated through fuzzy logic. The preliminary experimental results show that the PPG signals have predominant characteristics that can be used to identify different persons. With the fuzzy- based decision-making method, the rate of correct verification can reach up to 94% (one out of seventeen in error) within the same trial. and 82.3% wii:h two different trials (three out of seventeen in errors). The result for two different o-ials is not yet satisfactory},
  note = {perhaps mainly due to the variations in the contacting force applied on the PPG sensor during different trials. Further research based on transmission PPG sensor is necessary; because the finger clip can possibly avoid such. intra-subject variations. It is ;also desir:ible to further explore a better fuzzy implementation method such as new membership functions. to improve the performance of PPG-based authentication.
